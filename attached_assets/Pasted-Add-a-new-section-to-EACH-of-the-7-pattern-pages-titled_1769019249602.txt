Add a new section to EACH of the 7 pattern pages titled "Why Therapy Doesn't Fix This Pattern"

This section should appear after the main pattern description but BEFORE the one-line anchor we added in Step 2.

Add these specific sections to each pattern page:

---

PATTERN 1 - THE DISAPPEARING ACT:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy will help you understand WHY you disappear.

Childhood abandonment.
Attachment wounds.
Fear of intimacy.

All true. All valid.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from ghosting your best friend three days from now.

The Archivist Method teaches you to FEEL the pattern activating in your body—

That specific tightness in your chest, that urge to check your phone one more time, that thought: "They're better off without me"—

And interrupt it RIGHT THERE.

Before you ghost.
Before you disappear.
Before the damage.

That's not therapy.
That's real-time pattern interruption.

---

PATTERN 2 - THE APOLOGY LOOP:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy helps you understand your excessive apologizing.

Low self-worth.
People-pleasing conditioning.
Trauma response.

All true.

But understanding WHY you apologize doesn't stop you from saying "sorry" five times in the next conversation.

The Archivist Method teaches you to catch the word forming in your throat—

That automatic "sorry" for existing, for taking up space, for having needs—

And interrupt it before it leaves your mouth.

Then redirect: What do I actually need to say here?

That's not therapy.
That's pattern interruption in action.

---

PATTERN 3 - THE TESTING PATTERN:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy will help you understand why you test people.

Abandonment fears.
Trust issues.
Anxious attachment.

All valid.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from pushing people away to see if they'll stay.

The Archivist Method teaches you to recognize the test forming—

That urge to cancel plans, to create distance, to see if they'll chase you—

And interrupt it before you sabotage another relationship.

Then redirect: What do I actually need? Can I ask for it directly?

That's not therapy.
That's real-time recognition.

---

PATTERN 4 - ATTRACTION TO HARM:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy will help you understand why chaos feels safe.

Familiar dysfunction.
Learned associations.
Trauma bonding.

All true.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from choosing the red flag person tomorrow night.

The Archivist Method teaches you to feel the pull toward chaos—

That excitement that feels like chemistry, that drama that feels like passion—

And recognize it as pattern activation, not attraction.

Then interrupt before you commit.

That's not therapy.
That's pattern recognition that saves you years.

---

PATTERN 5 - COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy helps you understand why you can't accept praise.

Low self-esteem.
Imposter syndrome.
Worthiness wounds.

All true.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from deflecting the next compliment you receive.

The Archivist Method teaches you to catch the deflection rising—

That urge to minimize, to joke it away, to redirect to someone else—

And interrupt it before it leaves your mouth.

Then redirect: "Thank you" and nothing else.

That's not therapy.
That's reprogramming in real-time.

---

PATTERN 6 - THE DRAINING BOND:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy will help you understand your codependency.

Caretaker conditioning.
Boundary issues.
Self-abandonment patterns.

All valid.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from answering that 2 AM crisis call from someone who never changes.

The Archivist Method teaches you to feel the pull to rescue—

That urgency, that "they need me," that familiar role—

And interrupt it before you abandon yourself again.

Then redirect: What do I need right now?

That's not therapy.
That's boundary enforcement through pattern recognition.

---

PATTERN 7 - SUCCESS SABOTAGE:

WHY THERAPY DOESN'T FIX THIS PATTERN

Therapy helps you understand why you self-sabotage.

Fear of success.
Worthiness issues.
Comfort zone attachment.

All true.

But understanding WHY doesn't stop you from abandoning your next project at 87% complete.

The Archivist Method teaches you to recognize the sabotage impulse—

That sudden "new idea" that feels more exciting, that urge to pivot, that voice saying "this isn't good enough"—

And interrupt it before you kill another dream.

Then redirect: What's one small step forward on THIS project?

That's not therapy.
That's completion through interruption.

Styling notes:
- Section headline should be bold and clear
- Lists should use bullet points where shown
- The italic/emphasized text (like "FEEL the pattern activating") should be visually distinct
- Maintain consistent formatting across all 7 pattern pages
- Each section should flow naturally into the one-line anchor that follows it
- The closing "That's not therapy" line should have visual emphasis
