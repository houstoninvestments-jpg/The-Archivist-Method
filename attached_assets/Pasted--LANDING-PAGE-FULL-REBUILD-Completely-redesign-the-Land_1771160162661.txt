# LANDING PAGE FULL REBUILD

Completely redesign the Landing.tsx page. Keep the same route (/), same CTA destinations (/quiz), same brand colors. Replace ALL current content and layout with this new design.

## DESIGN DIRECTION

Cinematic. Editorial. Dark. Like opening a classified file, not browsing a website. Think: documentary title sequence meets premium editorial magazine. Every scroll should feel like turning a page in something dangerous.

## BRAND SYSTEM

Colors:
- Background: #0A0A0A (near black, NOT #1A1A1A — darker)
- Primary text: #F5F5F5 (warm white)
- Muted text: #737373
- Teal accent: #14B8A6 (use sparingly — highlights, not decoration)
- Pink accent: #EC4899 (danger moments only — pattern names, warnings)
- Card backgrounds: rgba(255,255,255,0.03) with 1px border rgba(255,255,255,0.06)

Typography (import from Google Fonts):
- Headlines: "Playfair Display" — serif, editorial weight
- Body: "Source Sans 3" — clean, readable
- Accent/labels: "JetBrains Mono" — monospace, technical feel (for things like "PATTERN #1", "DOOR 1", "3-7 SECONDS")

Effects:
- Keep the existing particle/floating dot animation — do NOT remove it
- Add subtle fade-in-up animations on scroll (use framer-motion or intersection observer)
- Sections should animate in as user scrolls, staggered
- No hover glow effects on cards — use subtle border brightening only

## PAGE STRUCTURE (in exact order)

### SECTION 1: HERO (full viewport height)

No background image. No wizard. Pure black with particles.

Layout: centered, generous whitespace

```
[small monospace text, muted, tracking-widest]
PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, NOT THERAPY

[massive Playfair Display headline, 5-7rem, bold]
You already know
what you're doing.

[body text, muted, 1.2rem, max-width 500px, centered]
You watch yourself do it. You know it's happening.
You do it anyway.

[teal text, 1.1rem, letter-spaced]
This method teaches you to interrupt it.

[CTA button — NOT teal background. White text, white border, transparent bg. On hover: white bg, black text. Uppercase, letter-spaced, monospace font]

```

The hero should breathe. Massive padding. Let the words sit in darkness.

---

### SECTION 2: THE GUT CHECK (pattern names as impact)

No header. Just a single line:

```
[muted text]
One of these is running your life right now:

[Then a horizontal scrolling ticker or a staggered grid of pattern names in pink, large, bold, Playfair Display — each one slightly offset, like a police evidence board]

Disappearing · Apology Loop · Testing · Attraction to Harm · Compliment Deflection · Draining Bond · Success Sabotage · Perfectionism · Rage

[below, centered, teal]
Which one made your stomach drop?
```

This section should feel like getting called out. Not informational — visceral.

---

### SECTION 3: WHO THIS IS FOR / NOT FOR

Two-column layout (stack on mobile):

Left card: "THIS IS FOR YOU IF:" with teal left border
- You watch yourself do destructive things and can't stop
- You've been in therapy for years but still run the same patterns
- You understand WHY you do it but can't stop DOING it
- You sabotage relationships, success, or stability
- You're tired of insight and ready for interruption

Right card: "THIS IS NOT FOR YOU IF:" with pink left border
- You're in crisis and need immediate professional help
- You want someone else to fix you
- You're looking for a quick fix with no effort
- You want to understand your childhood (get therapy)
- You're not ready to see your patterns clearly

Below cards:
```
[bold white]
This method requires you to watch yourself, name what you see, and interrupt it in real-time.
[teal italic]
That's the work. That's all of it.
```

---

### SECTION 4: THE 9 DESTRUCTIVE PATTERNS

```
[monospace, muted, small]
CLASSIFIED — 9 IDENTIFIED PATTERNS

[large Playfair headline]
The 9 Destructive Patterns
```

Grid: 3 columns desktop, 1 mobile. Each card:
- Pattern number in pink (large, monospace)
- Pattern name in white (bold)
- One-line description in muted text
- Subtle border, dark card bg
- On hover: border goes teal, slight lift

Use the exact same pattern descriptions from the current site — they're perfect.

After the grid:
```
[centered, teal link]
Discover your pattern →  (links to /quiz)
```

---

### SECTION 5: THE 3-7 SECOND WINDOW

This is your most powerful visual. Rebuild it bigger and bolder.

```
[monospace, muted]
THE SCIENCE

[Playfair headline]
You have 3-7 seconds.

[body text]
Right now, your patterns run in a 3-7 second window:
```

Then the flow diagram — keep the same concept (TRIGGER → BODY SIGNATURE → THOUGHT → PATTERN EXECUTES) but make it more cinematic:
- Horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile
- The "BODY SIGNATURE" step should have a glowing teal border/highlight
- "INTERRUPT HERE" arrow in pink, pulsing subtly
- The "3-7 SECOND WINDOW" label should feel like a warning badge

```
[below diagram]
Pattern archaeology teaches you to recognize the pattern BEFORE it runs.
In that 3-7 second window. In that recognition, you create a gap.
In that gap, you can interrupt the code.
```

---

### SECTION 6: THIS IS NOT THERAPY (comparison table only)

```
[Playfair headline, teal]
This is not therapy.
[subtitle, muted]
Here's the difference.
```

Clean comparison table — two columns:
- Left: THERAPY (muted text)
- Right: THE ARCHIVIST METHOD (white text, bold)

Same rows as current site. Clean lines, no heavy borders. Subtle row separators.

After table:
```
Both have value. They solve different problems.
[bold] If you need to heal, get therapy.
[teal] If you need to interrupt, get this.
```

---

### SECTION 7: HOW IT WORKS (3 steps — condensed)

```
[monospace, muted]
THE PROTOCOL

[Playfair headline]
How Pattern Interruption Works
```

Three steps — horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile. Each step is a card with:
- Large number (teal, monospace)
- Step name (bold white)
- 2 sentences max

Step 1: IDENTIFY YOUR PATTERN — Take the 2-minute assessment. Get the specific survival code running your life.
Step 2: LEARN YOUR BODY SIGNATURE — Your body signals the pattern 3-7 seconds before it runs. Learn to recognize your warning.
Step 3: INTERRUPT & TRACK — When you feel it activate, speak your circuit break statement. Track attempts. You get better every time.

```
[centered]
The 7-day protocol gives you proof of concept.
One successful interrupt = the method works for you.
```

---

### SECTION 8: CHOOSE YOUR PATH (pricing)

```
[Playfair headline]
Choose Your Path
[muted subtitle]
Pattern interruption at every level
```

Three pricing cards — same content as current but redesigned:
- Cards have subtle glass-morphism effect (backdrop-blur, slight transparency)
- Middle card ($47 Field Guide) has teal border and "MOST POPULAR" badge
- Right card ($197 Complete Archive) has pink "Enter The Archive →" button
- Left card (Free) is understated — no heavy border

Keep all current pricing copy, feature lists, and button destinations exactly the same.

---

### SECTION 9: ABOUT THE ARCHIVIST (founder section)

```
[monospace, muted]
FIELD NOTES

[Playfair headline]
About The Archivist
```

```
I've been an entrepreneur since I was 11 years old.
I've raised 8 kids. Started businesses. Failed at most of them.
Worked 19 years behind a bar — not because it was my identity,
but because it gave me the flexibility to chase what mattered.

What I didn't expect was that the bar would become a laboratory.

Thousands of people. Thousands of patterns. Same loops, different faces.
The person who blows up every relationship three months in.
The one who apologizes for breathing.
The one who destroys everything right before it works.

Then I realized: I was running them too. All of them.

So I stopped trying to understand why.
I started learning to interrupt.

The Archivist Method is what came out of that.
Not theory. Not textbook psychology.
Field research — performed while running the patterns it documents.

— The Archivist
```

### SECTION 10: FINAL CTA

Full-width, minimal, centered. Maximum whitespace.

```
[large Playfair headline]

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. Remove the current hero background image (wizard). Pure dark background with particles only.
2. Remove ALL old section images (the small preview images floating on the right side of current page)
3. Keep the existing particle animation system — do not remove or modify it
4. Every section should fade in on scroll (use intersection observer or framer-motion)
5. Page should feel SHORTER than current — no redundant therapy explanations
6. No FAQ section on this page (we'll add a separate /faq route later if needed)
7. Mobile responsive — all grids become single column, hero text scales down
8. Import Google Fonts: Playfair Display (700), Source Sans 3 (400, 600), JetBrains Mono (400)
9. All CTA buttons link to /quiz
10. Pricing buttons: Free → /quiz, Field Guide → Stripe checkout, Complete Archive → Stripe checkout (keep existing Stripe integration)
11. Smooth scroll behavior on the page
12. Delete the old Landing.tsx content completely — this is a full replacement
13. No "Four Doors" section as a separate block — it's covered by the 3-7 second window and the 3-step process
14. Total sections: 10 (hero, gut check, who it's for, 9 patterns, 3-7 second window, not therapy table, how it works, pricing, founder, final CTA) + footer

Build this now. Make it cinematic. Make it premium. This is a $250k brand.
