THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™

7-DAY CRASH COURSE




You have a pattern destroying your life.
You know you have it. You watch yourself do it.
You do it anyway.

This week, you identify it, feel it activate, and interrupt it once.

Seven days. One pattern. One successful interrupt.




PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, NOT THERAPY

## WHAT THIS IS

### Page 1

```
WHAT THIS IS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE 90-DAY PROBLEM

Every program wants 90 days. Journal for 90 days. Meditate 
for 90 days. Track your feelings for 90 days.

You have a life. Maybe ADHD. Maybe depression. Maybe trauma. 
Maybe just chaos. 90 days feels impossible before you start.

So you buy the program. You do Day 1. Maybe Day 2. Then it 
sits in your downloads folder for three years.

You need to know if this works NOW. Not in 90 days.


WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS WEEK

Fuck 90 days. Here's what happens this week:

Day 1: Identify which pattern is running your life
Day 2: Learn what it feels like in your body before it runs
Day 3: Find what triggers it
Day 4: Learn how to interrupt it
Day 5: Try to interrupt it once
Day 6: Try again, better
Day 7: Decide if you want to keep going

One successful interrupt. That's your proof this works. 
Everything else is optional.
```

### Page 2

```
WHAT THIS IS NOT

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is not therapy. We're not processing your trauma. We're 
not exploring your inner child. We're not journaling about feelings.

This is pattern interruption. Behavioral forensics. You have 
a program running. We're going to interrupt it mid-execution.

Therapy explains why the house is on fire. 
This teaches you to stop lighting matches.


THE RULES

RULE 1: PICK ONE PATTERN
You probably have three or four patterns running. Ignore them. 
Pick one. Work on that. The others can wait.

RULE 2: DO NOT AIM FOR PERFECTION
You're not mastering this pattern in 7 days. You're seeing if 
the method works for you. One successful interrupt = proof of concept.

RULE 3: TRACK JUST ENOUGH
When the pattern activates, write down what happened. One sentence. 
Move on. This is data collection, not journaling.

RULE 4: FAILURE IS DATA
You will try to interrupt the pattern and it will run anyway. 
That's not failure. That's information.


THE ONLY WAY TO FAIL THIS WEEK

Quit before Day 7.

## THE 9 PATTERNS

```
THE 9 PATTERNS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

One of these is destroying your life. Read all nine. Notice 
which one made your stomach drop.


1. THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN

You meet someone. Three months in, they say I love you. Your 
chest gets tight. You ghost them by Tuesday.

What it costs you: Relationships that never get past 90 days. 
Chronic loneliness. Serial almost-relationships.


2. THE APOLOGY LOOP

Sorry to bother you. Sorry, quick question. Sorry for existing.

What it costs you: Can't negotiate salary. Can't state boundaries. 
People walk over you because you trained them to.


3. THE TESTING PATTERN

You pick fights at 11pm to see if they'll still be there at 
breakfast. You push them away to see if they'll fight to stay.

What it costs you: Exhausted partners. Pushed away people who 
cared. Self-fulfilling abandonment prophecy.


4. ATTRACTION TO HARM

The nice guy feels boring. The unavailable one feels like 
chemistry. Red flags feel like attraction, not warning.

What it costs you: Serial toxic relationships. Can't stay 
attracted to healthy partners. The good ones feel wrong.


5. THE DRAINING BOND

You know you should leave. Everyone tells you to leave. You stay.

What it costs you: Years in toxic jobs or relationships. 
Chronic depletion. Watching your life pass while staying stuck.


6. COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

Someone says "nice work." You say "oh it was nothing." They 
stop complimenting you.

What it costs you: Career stagnation. Underpaid despite talent. 
Invisible to people who could help you.


7. THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN

If it's not perfect, it's garbage. So you don't finish. Or 
you don't start.

What it costs you: Pattern of almost-finished projects. Ideas 
that die in your head. Years spent polishing things no one sees.


8. SUCCESS SABOTAGE

You're three weeks from launching. Everything's going well. 
Suddenly you stop working. Or pick a fight. Or miss the deadline.

What it costs you: Pattern of almost-success then failure. 
Watching less talented people succeed because they can tolerate it.


9. THE RAGE PATTERN

It comes out of nowhere. One second you're fine, the next 
you're saying things you can't take back.

What it costs you: Damaged relationships. Trust that takes 
years to rebuild. A version of yourself you're ashamed of.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Which one made your stomach drop?

That's your pattern.
```

-----

## DAY 1: IDENTIFY YOUR PATTERN

```
DAY 1: IDENTIFY YOUR PATTERN

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Time: 20-30 minutes


YOUR TASK

You read the 9 patterns. One of them hit different. That's 
the one you're working on this week.

Write it down:

MY PATTERN: ________________________________________________

HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN RUNNING IT: ____________________________

WHAT HAS IT COST ME: ________________________________________

___________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________


THE ORIGINAL ROOM

Your pattern didn't come from nowhere. It installed in childhood. 
Not because something happened TO you—because you learned to 
DO something to survive.

The Original Room is not a literal room. It's the emotional 
environment where this pattern made sense.

You don't need to process the Original Room right now. You 
don't need to decode it. You just need to know it exists so 
you understand why the pattern feels so automatic.

The pattern was a survival strategy. It worked once. 
It doesn't anymore.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 1 complete.

Tomorrow you learn to feel the pattern activate BEFORE it runs.
```

-----

## DAY 2: LEARN THE BODY SIGNATURE

```
DAY 2: LEARN THE BODY SIGNATURE

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Time: All day awareness


THE 3-7 SECOND WINDOW

Before your pattern runs, your body signals it. Every time.

Chest tightness. Stomach drop. Throat closing. Heart racing. 
Jaw clenching. Heat in your face. Something.

This is the body signature. It happens 3-7 seconds before 
the pattern executes.

Right now, you don't notice it. The trigger happens, the 
pattern runs, and you realize what happened afterward.

Today you learn to catch it in real time.


COMMON BODY SIGNATURES BY PATTERN

Disappearing: Chest tightness. Urge to flee. Walls closing in.
Apology Loop: Guilt. Throat tightening. Shrinking sensation.
Testing: Panic. Heart racing. Scanning for signs they'll leave.
Attraction to Harm: Excitement. "Chemistry." Pull toward danger.
Draining Bond: Heavy guilt. Obligation. Trapped feeling.
Compliment Deflection: Squirming. Heat. Want to disappear.
Perfectionism: Paralysis. Dread. Gap between vision and reality.
Success Sabotage: Panic. "Something bad is coming." Urge to stop.
Rage: Heat rising. Jaw tight. Pressure building.


TODAY'S TASK

When your pattern activates today—and it will—don't try to 
stop it. Just notice.

What did your body feel BEFORE you executed the pattern?

Activation 1:
Time: _______ What happened: ______________________________
Body sensation: ___________________________________________

Activation 2:
Time: _______ What happened: ______________________________
Body sensation: ___________________________________________

Activation 3:
Time: _______ What happened: ______________________________
Body sensation: ___________________________________________


You're not interrupting the pattern yet. You're just seeing it.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 2 complete.

Tomorrow you identify what triggers it.
```

-----

## DAY 3: FIND YOUR TRIGGERS

```
DAY 3: FIND YOUR TRIGGERS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Time: 15 minutes + all day awareness


WHAT IS A TRIGGER

The situation that happens RIGHT BEFORE your pattern activates.

Your pattern doesn't run randomly. It runs in response to 
specific triggers.

Know your triggers and you can see the pattern coming 
before it runs.


COMMON TRIGGERS BY PATTERN

Disappearing: "I love you." Future plans. Relationship milestones.
Apology Loop: Needing to ask for help. Wanting something. Boundaries.
Testing: Slow text response. Partner seems distant. Things going well.
Attraction to Harm: Meeting someone with red flags. Safe person interest.
Draining Bond: Thinking about leaving. Someone saying "you deserve better."
Compliment Deflection: Being praised. Visibility. Someone noticing you.
Perfectionism: Deadline approaching. About to share work. Feedback.
Success Sabotage: Approaching milestone. Things going well too long.
Rage: Feeling dismissed. Being contradicted. Losing control.


TODAY'S TASK

Track what triggers your pattern today. Not what the pattern 
does—what happens RIGHT BEFORE.

TRIGGER 1: ________________________________________________

TRIGGER 2: ________________________________________________

TRIGGER 3: ________________________________________________


END OF DAY: YOUR TOP 3 TRIGGERS

These are the situations where you need to be ready:

1. ________________________________________________________

2. ________________________________________________________

3. ________________________________________________________


─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 3 complete.

Tomorrow you learn how to interrupt it.
```

-----

## DAY 4: LEARN YOUR CIRCUIT BREAK

```
DAY 4: LEARN YOUR CIRCUIT BREAK

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Time: 15 minutes to memorize


WHAT IS A CIRCUIT BREAK

A pre-written script you say when the pattern activates. Out 
loud or in your head. It interrupts the automatic sequence.

Right now:
Trigger → Body signature → Pattern runs (3-7 seconds, automatic)

With circuit break:
Trigger → Body signature → CIRCUIT BREAK → Choose different behavior

The circuit break creates a gap. In that gap, you can choose.


YOUR CIRCUIT BREAK SCRIPT

Find your pattern. Memorize this script. Say it when the body 
signature hits.


DISAPPEARING:
"The Disappearing Pattern just activated. I feel the walls 
closing in. The program wants me to pull away. I'm choosing 
to stay and communicate instead."

APOLOGY LOOP:
"I'm about to apologize for asking. I've done nothing wrong. 
I'm replacing 'sorry' with what I actually need to say."

TESTING:
"The Testing Pattern activated. I want to create a test. I'm 
not doing that. I'm asking directly instead."

ATTRACTION TO HARM:
"I feel chemistry with this person. Let me check: are they 
safe or familiar? This might be pattern recognition, not love."

DRAINING BOND:
"I know I should leave. The guilt is the pattern talking. 
Leaving is self-preservation, not betrayal."

COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION:
"Someone just acknowledged me. I want to deflect. I'm saying 
only: thank you. No deflection. No minimizing."

PERFECTIONISM:
"Perfectionism is telling me it's not ready. Done is better 
than perfect. I'm shipping it."

SUCCESS SABOTAGE:
"I'm close to succeeding. Success Sabotage is activating. 
This is the pattern, not reality. I'm allowed to win."

RAGE:
"I feel the anger rising. This is the Rage Pattern. I'm not 
saying anything for 10 seconds. Breathe."


TODAY'S TASK

1. Write your circuit break on paper or in your phone
2. Say it out loud 5 times
3. Imagine your most recent trigger and practice saying it

Tomorrow you use it for real.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 4 complete.
```

-----

## DAY 5: FIRST INTERRUPT ATTEMPT

```
DAY 5: FIRST INTERRUPT ATTEMPT

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Success = attempting the circuit break


WHAT TO EXPECT

Today your pattern will activate. When it does:

Step 1: Feel the body signature
Step 2: Say your circuit break
Step 3: Attempt different behavior


LIKELY OUTCOMES

70% chance — AUTO: Pattern runs anyway. You feel it, you say 
the circuit break, the pattern executes anyway. This is normal. 
This is data. You TRIED.

20% chance — PAUSE: You pause before the pattern runs. Maybe 
2 seconds. Maybe 10. Then it runs anyway. This is progress. 
You created a GAP.

10% chance — REWRITE: You successfully interrupt. Rare on Day 5. 
If it happens, you're ahead of schedule.


TODAY'S TRACKING

Attempt 1:
Time: _______ 
Trigger: __________________________________________________
Body signature felt? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Circuit break said? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Outcome: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE

Attempt 2:
Time: _______ 
Trigger: __________________________________________________
Body signature felt? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Circuit break said? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Outcome: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE


AUTO is not failure. It's data. Write it down.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 5 complete.

Tomorrow we use today's data to do better.
```

-----

## DAY 6: REFINE AND RETRY

```
DAY 6: REFINE AND RETRY

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use yesterday's data


WHAT WENT WRONG YESTERDAY

Check what made interruption difficult:

[ ] Pattern ran too fast—didn't catch body signature in time
[ ] Forgot circuit break in the moment
[ ] Body sensation was too intense to think
[ ] Didn't recognize the trigger until after


ADJUSTMENTS

If pattern ran too fast: Pre-load the circuit break. Say it 
when you wake up. Say it before entering triggering situations. 
Keep it loaded.

If you forgot the circuit break: Set phone alarm every 2 hours 
with the reminder: "What's my circuit break?" Keep it front of mind.

If body sensation was too intense: Add 3 deep breaths before 
the circuit break. Breath → Circuit break → Choose.

If you missed the trigger: Watch specifically for your top 3 
triggers today. You know what they are now.


TODAY'S TRACKING

Attempt 1:
Trigger: _________________ Outcome: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE

Attempt 2:
Trigger: _________________ Outcome: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE

Attempt 3:
Trigger: _________________ Outcome: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE


END OF DAY 6

Did you successfully interrupt at least once?

[ ] Yes — You have proof this works
[ ] No, but I paused — Progress. You're slowing it down.
[ ] No, still runs automatically — Some patterns need more time.


─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 6 complete.

Tomorrow you decide what's next.
```

-----

## DAY 7: DECIDE YOUR NEXT STEP

```
DAY 7: DECIDE YOUR NEXT STEP

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Time: 15 minutes


YOUR WEEK IN REVIEW

Pattern identified: ________________________________________

Body signature: ____________________________________________

Top triggers: ______________________________________________

Best outcome achieved: [ ] AUTO [ ] PAUSE [ ] REWRITE


WHAT YOUR RESULTS MEAN

IF YOU ACHIEVED REWRITE (even once):
The method works for you. You interrupted a pattern that's 
been running for years. That's not luck. That's proof.

Next step: The Field Guide has your full 90-day protocol.

IF YOU ACHIEVED PAUSE:
You're slowing the pattern down. That gap you created will 
get longer with practice.

Next step: Keep going. You need more reps, not a different method.

IF PATTERN STILL RUNS ON AUTO:
Several possibilities:
• Wrong pattern — try a different one
• Need more time — some patterns need 30+ days to start breaking
• This method isn't for you — that's valid data too


YOUR DECISION

[ ] Get The Field Guide — full 90-day protocol for my pattern
[ ] Get The Complete Archive — all 9 patterns, full system
[ ] Keep practicing with what I have
[ ] Try a different pattern
[ ] Stop here


─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Whatever you choose, you did something most people never do.

You looked at the pattern. You named it. You tried to interrupt it.

That's not nothing. That's the first step.

The pattern doesn't own you anymore. You see it now.

You found the thread. Now pull it.
