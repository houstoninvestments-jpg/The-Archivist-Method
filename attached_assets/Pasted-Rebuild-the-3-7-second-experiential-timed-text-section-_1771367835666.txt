Rebuild the 3-7 second experiential timed text section. The current version only shows one pattern's body signatures which misses most visitors. The new version cycles through multiple patterns so everyone recognizes themselves.

CONCEPT: The section plays a repeating sequence. Each cycle shows a different pattern's trigger → body signature → pull to act. The visitor watches multiple patterns pass by until THEIRS hits and they feel it. Then the payoff line lands.

IMPLEMENTATION:

When the section scrolls into view (intersection observer, threshold 0.4), begin the sequence.

INTRO (plays once, never repeats):

[Delay 0.5s, fade in]
[JetBrains Mono, 12px, teal, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.2em]
THE WINDOW

[Delay 1.5s, fade in]
[Playfair Display, 2.2rem, white]
"Every pattern has a signature."

[Delay 3.0s, fade in]
[Source Sans 3, 1.1rem, #999]
"Your body sends it 3-7 seconds before the behavior runs."

[Delay 4.5s — intro text fades to 40% opacity and stays as background context]

PATTERN CYCLE (starts at 5.0s, each pattern gets 4 seconds):

Each pattern cycle shows 3 lines that fade in sequentially, hold for a moment, then all 3 fade out before the next pattern begins. Centered. Max-width 500px.

Line 1 (fade in at 0.0s of cycle): The trigger situation
Style: Source Sans 3, 1.15rem, #777

Line 2 (fade in at 0.8s of cycle): The body signature
Style: Source Sans 3, 1.15rem, white

Line 3 (fade in at 1.6s of cycle): The pull / urge
Style: Source Sans 3, 1.15rem, white, slightly brighter

All 3 lines fade out together at 3.2s of cycle. 0.8s gap of nothing. Next pattern begins.

THE CYCLES:

Cycle 1 — DISAPPEARING:
"Someone says I love you."
"Your chest tightens. Your hands go cold."
"You're already planning how to leave."

Cycle 2 — APOLOGY LOOP:
"You ask a question in a meeting."
"Your throat closes. Stomach drops."
"You're already apologizing for speaking."

Cycle 3 — SUCCESS SABOTAGE:
"The project is almost finished."
"Your hands start shaking. Restless heat."
"You're about to delete six months of work."

Cycle 4 — TESTING:
"Things are going well with them."
"Jaw clenches. Pulse quickens."
"You're about to start a fight to see if they'll stay."

Cycle 5 — ATTRACTION TO HARM:
"They hurt you again."
"Numbness spreads. Familiar warmth."
"You're going back. You already know you are."

After all 5 cycles complete (about 25 seconds total):

THE PAYOFF (fades in and stays):

[1.0s pause after last cycle fades]

[Playfair Display, 2rem, white, fade in over 0.8s]
"Did one of those hit?"

[1.5s pause]

[Playfair Display, 2.5rem, teal, fade in over 0.8s]
"That was your window."

[1.5s pause]

[Source Sans 3, 1.1rem, #999, fade in over 0.6s]
"This method teaches you what to do inside it."

The payoff lines stay visible permanently after appearing. They do not fade out.

DESIGN DETAILS:
- The entire section has generous padding (120px top and bottom minimum)
- Background stays #0A0A0A, no special effects
- All text centered
- The pattern name is NOT shown during each cycle — the visitor doesn't know which pattern they're seeing. They just feel it. This is intentional. The recognition comes from the body signature description, not a label.
- Smooth, elegant transitions. Fade duration 0.4s ease for all appears and disappears.
- The sequence plays ONCE per page load. After the payoff lines appear, if the user scrolls away and back, they see the final state (payoff lines visible, cycles done).
- On mobile: same sequence, same timing, slightly smaller text (1rem body, 1.8rem Playfair)

DO NOT show all patterns simultaneously. DO NOT use cards or grids. The power is in the sequential reveal — one at a time, building tension, until one of them lands.
