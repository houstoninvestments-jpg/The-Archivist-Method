Convert the landing page Greeter Assistant chatbot into an interactive Pattern Identification Quiz.

CURRENT CHATBOT LOCATION:
Find the Greeter Assistant component on the landing page (likely in /client/src/components/ or similar).

NEW FUNCTIONALITY - PATTERN QUIZ:

QUIZ STRUCTURE:
The chatbot will ask 7-10 conversational questions (one at a time) to identify which of the 7 destructive patterns the user is running.

THE 7 PATTERNS:
1. Disappearing Pattern - Vanish when relationships get close, ghost when intimacy increases
2. Apology Loop - Apologize for existing, constant "sorry to bother you"
3. Testing Pattern - Push people away to see if they'll stay, create loyalty tests
4. Attraction to Harm - Toxic feels like chemistry, safe people feel boring
5. Compliment Deflection - Cannot accept praise, visibility triggers panic
6. Draining Bond - Stay bonded to harmful people/situations, can't leave despite knowing you should
7. Success Sabotage - Destroy things right before they succeed, can't tolerate sustained wins

SAMPLE QUESTIONS (create 7-10 similar):
- "When someone gets close to you, what's your first instinct?" (flee/test them/get closer)
- "How do you feel when someone compliments your work?" (uncomfortable/suspicious/grateful)
- "You're 3 weeks from a big goal. What happens?" (push harder/sabotage/lose interest)
- "When you need to ask for help, how do you start the conversation?" (apologize first/ask directly/avoid asking)
- "Safe, stable people feel..." (boring/comfortable/what I want)
- "When thinking about leaving a toxic situation, you feel..." (guilt/relief/trapped)
- "Your partner says 'I love you' for the first time. Your chest feels..." (tight/warm/panicked)

QUIZ FLOW:
1. Opening: "I'm The Archivist. I can identify which pattern is destroying your life in under 2 minutes. Want to know which one you're running?"
2. Questions appear one at a time with typing animation
3. User selects from 2-3 options per question (buttons, not text input)
