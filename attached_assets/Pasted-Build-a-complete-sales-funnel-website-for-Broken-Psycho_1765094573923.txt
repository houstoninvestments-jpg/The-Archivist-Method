=== HOMEPAGE (index.html) ===

HERO SECTION:
- Dark background (#1a1a1a)
- Archivist logo (large, centered or left-aligned)
- H1: "THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™" (teal color, 48px)
- H2: "Pattern Archaeology, Not Therapy" (pink color, 24px)
- Paragraph: "Stop running the same destructive patterns. Therapy processes what happened. The Archivist Method™ interrupts what it made you do."
- CTA Button: "Start Free 7-Day Crash Course" (teal background #00FFC8, black text, links to /free-download.html)

HOW IT WORKS SECTION:
- H2: "You Keep Running the Same Patterns"
- Bullets:
  • You disappear when relationships get close
  • You apologize for existing
  • You test if people really love you
  • You're attracted to people who hurt you
  • You can't accept compliments
  • You stay in toxic situations
  • You sabotage right before success

- H2: "The Archivist Method™ Interrupts Them"
- 4 Steps (displayed as cards):
  1. IDENTIFY - Which pattern is running your life
  2. EXCAVATE - Find where it was installed (Original Room)
  3. CIRCUIT BREAK - Interrupt it before it executes
  4. REWRITE - Execute new behavior instead
