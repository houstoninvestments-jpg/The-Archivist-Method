Replace the current Investigation Board section with a full detective board experience. Apply now.

OVERALL FEEL:
Dark near-black background (#0A0A0A). Subtle cork/linen texture overlay at 4% opacity. Teal thread connects all cards like a detective evidence board. TAM brand colors throughout — teal thread, pink accents, white text.

THE THREAD:
- SVG curved path running vertically down center, teal (#14B8A6), 1.5px stroke
- Dashed line style: stroke-dasharray 6 4 — like string on a board
- Small teal pin/dot at each card connection point (8px circle)
- Glowing dot travels the thread tied to scroll position using Intersection Observer
- Dot: 12px, teal, soft radial glow, moves between pins as user scrolls

CARDS (6 total, staggered left and right, slightly rotated randomly -2deg to +2deg like pinned to a board):
- Size: 280px wide
- Background: aged paper texture using CSS (#1a1510 with noise)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
- Corner: small teal "CASE FILE" stamp in JetBrains Mono
- Pin: small teal circle at top center suggesting it's pinned to the board
- On scroll into view: fade in + slight rotate to 0 + teal border glow
- On hover: lifts (translateY -6px), pink glow, slight shadow

CARD CONTENT:
Card 1 (left, rotate -1.5deg):

Stamp: "AMYGDALA FIRE — CASE FILE 02"
Headline: "Your survival brain takes over."

Card 3 (left, rotate -1deg):
Stamp: "BODY SIGNATURE — CASE FILE 03"
Headline: "Your body knows before you do."

Card 4 (right, rotate +1.5deg):
Stamp: "THE WINDOW — CASE FILE 04"

Headline: "With the method — you choose."
