The METHOD IN 4 FRAMES section needs a full consistency pass. The images are correct and should not be changed. Fix the visual treatment so all 4 panels feel like one cohesive system:

**PANEL CONSISTENCY RULES — apply to all 4:**
- Same dark overlay gradient on every panel (bottom 40% of each image fades to #0a0a0a) so text is always readable
- Panel number (01, 02, 03, 04): top left, same font, same size, same teal color (#00d4aa), same opacity (60%), monospace
- Corner brackets: identical size, identical teal color, identical position on all 4 corners of all 4 panels
- Panel border: 1px solid rgba(0,212,170,0.2) on all 4 panels — subtle, consistent
- Caption below each panel: same font, same size, same letter-spacing, same teal color, centered

**PANEL 01 — SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED**
- Keep the brain lightning image
- Move headline and subtext to bottom left, inside the gradient overlay
- Headline: "SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED" — white, bold
- Subtext: "Before you heard it. Before you saw it." — pink, smaller
- Remove the floating text that sits awkwardly over the image top area

**PANEL 02 — YOUR BODY KNEW FIRST**
- Keep the wireframe body signal image  
- Move "YOUR BODY KNEW FIRST." headline to top of panel inside a dark overlay bar
- Subtext "This is not anxiety. This is your pattern loading." in pink below headline
- The body signal labels (THROAT CLOSES, CHEST DROPS, etc.) are fine — keep them

**PANEL 03 — 3-7 SECONDS**
- This panel needs the most work — it currently looks like a completely different design
- Keep the pink/teal energy wave image
- Apply the same dark overlay treatment as other panels
- Headline: "THE ONLY MOMENT THAT HAS EVER MATTERED." — white, bold, bottom of panel
- Keep the 3-7 SECONDS box but make it smaller and position it center of the image
- Remove THE PATTERN LOADING / THE INTERRUPT ZONE / THE OLD RESPONSE / THE NEW CHOICE labels — they're cluttering it
- Add just two labels flanking the 3-7 box: left side "PATTERN" in pink, right side "INTERRUPT" in teal

**PANEL 04 — YOU ARE NOT THAT CHILD ANYMORE**
- Keep the child/adult split image — this is the strongest panel
- Headline at bottom: "YOU ARE NOT THAT CHILD ANYMORE." — white, bold
- Subtext: "One trained response. The pattern breaks." — pink
- Remove the THE OLD WIRING / THE INTERRUPT FIRED header labels at top — the image speaks for itself

**CAPTION LABELS BELOW EACH PANEL:**
01 — THE HIT
02 — YOUR BODY KNEW FIRST  
03 — 3-7 SECONDS
04 — YOU ARE NOT THAT CHILD ANYMORE

All caps, same teal, same monospace font, same size, centered under each panel.

Do not change the images. Only fix the text treatment, overlays, borders, and consistency.
