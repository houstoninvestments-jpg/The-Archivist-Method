Run a comprehensive audit of the entire application. Check every single page, route, link, button, and piece of copy. Report back with a numbered list of every issue found.

CHECK ALL ROUTES — visit each one and confirm it loads without errors:
- / (landing page)
- /quiz
- /results
- /portal
- /portal/reader
- /vault/workbench
- /vault/archive
- /terms
- /privacy
- /contact (if it exists)
- Any other routes in App.tsx

CHECK ALL LINKS AND BUTTONS:
- Every CTA button on the landing page — does it link to /quiz?
- Every sidebar link in the portal — does it navigate correctly?
- "The Workbench" → /vault/workbench
- "The Archive" → /vault/archive
- "Talk to The Archivist" or "Back to Chat" → AI chat view
- "My Downloads" → downloads section
- "Settings" → settings view
- "I'm Activated" card → /vault/workbench
- "Brain Dump" card → /vault/workbench
- "Download PDF" button → correct PDF downloads
- All pricing buttons: Free → /quiz, Field Guide → Stripe checkout, Complete Archive → Stripe checkout

- "Discover your pattern" links throughout → /quiz

CHECK ALL COPY FOR CONSISTENCY:
- No references to "Broken Psychology" or old branding anywhere
- No placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum" or "[TODO]"
- No "2025" dates — should all be 2026
- All pattern names consistent: Disappearing, Apology Loop, Testing, Attraction to Harm, Compliment Deflection, Draining Bond, Success Sabotage, Perfectionism, Rage
- No therapy language: no "triggered", "coping mechanism", "healing journey", "safe space"
- Correct TAM language used: "activated", "interrupt", "circuit break", "body signature", "pattern archaeology"
- Founder section says "About The Founder" not "About The Archivist"
- Founder section ends with "For her." and "— Aaron"

CHECK DESIGN CONSISTENCY:
- All pages using the correct fonts: Playfair Display (headlines), Source Sans 3 (body), JetBrains Mono (monospace labels)
- All pages using correct colors: bg #0A0A0A, text #F5F5F5, muted #737373, teal #14B8A6, pink #EC4899
- No pages still using old design (lighter backgrounds, different fonts, old card styles)
