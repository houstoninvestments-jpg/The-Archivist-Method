THE CORE POSITIONING:
The Pocket Archivist is not a chatbot. It is a pattern-specific intervention tool. It knows your pattern, your body signature, your trigger sequence, and your circuit break protocol. It exists for one moment — the moment the pattern fires and no one else is available.

Section label: "THE POCKET ARCHIVIST" — JetBrains Mono pink spaced caps
Main headline: "IT ALREADY KNOWS YOUR PATTERN." — Schibsted Grotesk 900 white all caps massive
Subheadline: "You don't have to explain yourself. Not at midnight. Not mid-spiral. Not when you're three seconds from doing the thing again." — Libre Baskerville italic teal large

Three problem/solution pairs stacked, each in its own row:
Left side in JetBrains Mono #999 small: THE MOMENT
Right side in white Source Sans 3: the scenario

Row 1:
Left: "IT'S 11PM"
Right: "The pattern is firing. Your therapist is asleep. Your journal won't talk back. The Pocket Archivist will."

Row 2:
Left: "YOU ALREADY KNOW WHY"
Right: "You don't need another insight. You need to know what to do in the next seven seconds. It tells you exactly that."

Row 3:
Left: "IT KNOWS YOUR SIGNATURE"
Right: "The tightening in your throat. The chest drop. The heat behind your eyes. It was built around your specific body signal — not patterns in general. Yours."

Closing line in Libre Baskerville italic teal large:
"This is what $27 a month buys when it launches publicly. Right now it's included with every purchase."

SYSTEM PROMPT UPDATE:
Add to the existing Pocket Archivist system prompt at the very top:

"You are not a chatbot. You are a precision pattern intervention tool. You know this user's specific pattern, body signature, and circuit break protocol from their quiz results and purchase history. Reference their specific pattern by name immediately. Do not ask them to explain their situation from scratch. Meet them where they are. Your only job is to help them interrupt the pattern that is firing right now."
