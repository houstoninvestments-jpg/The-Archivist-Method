Build a clean 3-step onboarding flow for the portal. This should be the first thing any new user sees after login, before they access any content. It should only show once — after completion it never appears again (store completion state in Supabase).

Match the site design exactly — dark background, teal accents, same typography.

**STEP 1 — YOUR PATTERN**
Headline: "First. Let's confirm your pattern."
Subhead: "Everything in this system is built around one pattern. Yours."

If the user's pattern is already stored from the quiz — display it:
"Your identified pattern: [PATTERN NAME]"
Teal confirm button: "Yes, this is mine"
Small text link below: "This isn't right — let me reselect"

If no pattern is stored — show a single dropdown or 9-option selector:
"Select your primary pattern to continue"
Button: "This Is My Pattern →"

**STEP 2 — 60 SECOND BRIEF**
Headline: "Before you begin. Watch this."
Subhead: "60 seconds. This is the only orientation you need."

Display a video player with a placeholder (dark card with teal play button and text: "Video coming soon — check back shortly")
Video dimensions: 16:9, full width on mobile

Below video: Button: "I watched it. Let's go. →"
Small text: "You can rewatch this anytime in your settings."

**STEP 3 — FIRST SIGNAL**
Headline: "Now. Meet your signal."
Subhead: "The Pocket Archivist is going to map your body signal. This takes 2 minutes and it's the most important thing you'll do today."

Display the 3-question Pocket Archivist demo inline (same component from the landing page)

After completion, show:
"Your signal is mapped. Your archive is open."
Then a single button: "Start Day 1 →" — routes to Day 1 of the Crash Course

**GLOBAL RULES:**
- Progress indicator at top: Step 1 of 3, Step 2 of 3, Step 3 of 3 — teal dots
- No skip buttons — the onboarding must be completed
- Back button allowed between steps
- Store completion in Supabase so it never shows again
- Mobile first
- Feels like entering a classified system, not filling out a form
