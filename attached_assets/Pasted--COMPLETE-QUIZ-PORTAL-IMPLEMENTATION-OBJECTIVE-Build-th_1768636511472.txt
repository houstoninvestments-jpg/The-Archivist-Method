## PART 2: SCORING ALGORITHM

```javascript
// Initialize scores
const scores = {
  disappearing: 0,
  apologyLoop: 0,
  testing: 0,
  attractionToHarm: 0,
  complimentDeflection: 0,
  drainingBond: 0,
  successSabotage: 0
};

// For each question, add points for ALL selected options
// "None of these" selection clears all other selections for that question

// After all 10 questions answered, calculate results:

const total = Object.values(scores).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
const sortedPatterns = Object.entries(scores)
  .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1])
  .filter(([_, score]) => score > 0);

// Result determination:

if (total === 0) {
  // User selected "none of these" on every question
  → Show FALLBACK SCREEN (all 7 patterns, manual selection)
}
else if (sortedPatterns[0][1] >= 15) {
  // Strong primary pattern (5+ strong selections)
  → Show PRIMARY PATTERN result page
  → Include secondary patterns if score >= 6
}
else if (sortedPatterns.length >= 3 && sortedPatterns[2][1] >= 8) {
  // Multiple strong patterns
  → Show "MULTIPLE PATTERNS" result page
  → Display top 3-4 patterns with scores
}
else {
  // 1-2 moderate patterns
  → Show PRIMARY result page
  → Mention secondary if score >= 6
}
```

This means either:
• You're highly self-aware and already interrupting patterns
• Your patterns are more subtle than the quiz captures
• None of the 7 core patterns match your experience

Let me show you all 7 — read through them and pick the one that makes your stomach drop.
