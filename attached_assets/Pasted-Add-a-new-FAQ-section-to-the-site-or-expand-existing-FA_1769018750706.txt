Q: Is this therapy?

A: No. This is pattern archaeology.

Therapy asks: "Why do I do this?"
The Archivist Method asks: "What pattern am I running right now?"

Therapy is designed to help you understand your past.
This is designed to help you interrupt your present.

We're not healing trauma.
We're not processing emotions.
We're not building coping strategies.

We're teaching you to recognize patterns in real-time and interrupt them before they run.

That's not therapy.
That's pattern recognition training.

Think of it like this:
Therapy is archaeology of the past.
This is archaeology of the present.

Both have value.
They're just solving different problems.

Q: Can I do this instead of therapy?

A: That's not for me to say.

If you're in therapy and it's working, keep going.

This method works alongside therapy, not against it.

The difference:
Therapy helps you understand WHY you run patterns.
This helps you INTERRUPT them when they activate.

Understanding why ≠ stopping what.

You can have both.
You can have one.
You can have neither.

But if you're tired of understanding your patterns and ready to actually interrupt them—this is the method.

Q: Do I need to talk about my trauma?

A: No.

The Archivist Method doesn't require you to:
• Revisit your past
• Process your trauma
• Share your story
• Understand your childhood

All you need to do is:
• Recognize which pattern you're running
• Feel it activating in your body
• Interrupt it before the action
• Redirect the energy

Your past created the pattern.
But your present is where you break it.

We stay in your present.
