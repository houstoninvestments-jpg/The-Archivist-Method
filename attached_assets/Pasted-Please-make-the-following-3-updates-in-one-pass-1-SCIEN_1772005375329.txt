Please make the following 3 updates in one pass:

**1. SCIENCE SECTION — ADD DEPTH**
In the "THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE WINDOW" section, add 2 more research cards to the grid making it a 3x2 grid of 6 cards total:

Card 5:
2012
"Habits form through neurological loops the conscious mind cannot override."
— Duhigg, C. · The Power of Habit

Card 6:
2000
"The window between stimulus and response is where all change lives."
— Schwartz, J. · The Mind and the Brain

Below the badges add one more line in small teal text:
"This is not self-help. This is applied neuroscience."

**2. DEMO SECTION — CONVERT TO MODAL**
Remove the "MEET YOUR PATTERN" demo section from the main page scroll entirely.

Instead, in the existing POCKET ARCHIVIST section, add a single button below the copy:
Button text: "EXPERIENCE IT FREE →"
Style: Teal border, teal text, dark background — secondary button, not competing with the main quiz CTA

When clicked, open a full-screen modal overlay with:
- Dark background matching site
- The existing demo component inside it (3-question Pocket Archivist sequence)
- An X close button top right in teal
- The headline: "MEET YOUR PATTERN." at the top
- After completing all 3 questions, show the result then a CTA button: "Take The Full Quiz →" that closes the modal and scrolls to the quiz CTA

**3. FIX BENTO SCROLL ANIMATIONS**
The bento panel entrance animations are not triggering properly on scroll. Please fix:

- Lower the Intersection Observer threshold to 0.1 (trigger when just 10% of panel is visible)
- Increase the animation distance from 20px to 40px translateY for more noticeable lift
- Ensure stagger delay is working — each panel should animate 150ms after the previous one
- Add a stronger scale effect: start at 0.92, ease to 1.0
- On hover: translateY -6px, box-shadow with teal glow (0 0 20px rgba(0,212,170,0.3))
- Apply this fix to ALL bento cards across the entire site — patterns section, method section, archives section, everywhere

Test on both mobile and desktop before confirming complete.
