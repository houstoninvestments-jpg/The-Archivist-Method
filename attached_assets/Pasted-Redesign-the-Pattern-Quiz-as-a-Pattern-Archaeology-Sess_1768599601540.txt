Redesign the Pattern Quiz as a "Pattern Archaeology Session" with The Archivist analyzing the user.

NEW FLOW:

SCREEN 1 - INTRO
Archivist avatar with text:
"I'm The Archivist. I've catalogued over 10,000 destructive patterns. In the next 90 seconds, I'll identify which one is running your life. This works better if you're honest. Ready?"
[Button: "Yes, analyze me"]

SCREENS 2-5 - SCENARIO-BASED STATEMENTS (3-4 screens)
Show specific scenarios with multiple choice answers. Each scenario should reveal different patterns.

IMPORTANT: Every scenario must include "None of these" as the last option.

Example scenarios:
1. "You meet someone. Three months in, they say 'I love you.' Choose what happens next:"
   - My chest gets tight, I need space (Disappearing)
   - I wonder if they really mean it (Testing)
   - I feel uncomfortable but stay (Attraction to Harm)
   - None of these

2. "Someone compliments your work. Your immediate reaction:"
   - Minimize it ("anyone could have done this") (Compliment Deflection)
   - Feel suspicious of their motives (Testing)
   - Apologize for something unrelated (Apology Loop)
   - None of these

3. "You're approaching a major milestone. What typically happens?"
   - I sabotage it right before success (Success Sabotage)
   - I stay stuck in a situation holding me back (Draining Bond)
   - I pull away from support (Disappearing)
   - None of these

4. "When you need to ask for help, you typically:"
   - Start with "Sorry to bother you..." (Apology Loop)
   - Avoid asking entirely (Disappearing/Draining Bond)
   - Test if they'll offer first (Testing)
   - None of these

SCREEN 6 - ANALYSIS
"Analyzing patterns..."
[Animated loading with teal glow effect - 2-3 seconds]

SCREEN 7 - RESULTS

IF clear pattern identified (user selected pattern-specific answers 2+ times):
"You're running the [PATTERN NAME]."
[Show full pattern description with examples]
"This pattern has been running for years. Sound right?"
[Button: "Yes, that's me"] [Button: "No, show me all patterns"]

IF no clear pattern (user selected "None of these" on most questions):
"I can't identify your primary pattern from those responses. Let me show you all 7 - read through them and pick the one that made your stomach drop."
[Show all 7 patterns with descriptions, user selects one]

SCREEN 8 - EMAIL CAPTURE
"Your [PATTERN NAME] is destroying your [life area based on pattern]. I can teach you to interrupt it in 7 days. Want the protocol?"
[Email form]
[Button: "Send Me The Free Course"]

DESIGN:
- Keep the dark theme with teal accents
- Archivist avatar visible throughout
- Progress indicator showing "Analysis in progress"
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Results reveal should feel significant (animation, emphasis)
- Make "None of these" clearly visible but not prominent (users should try the pattern-specific answers first)

TECHNICAL:
- Track which answers map to which patterns
- If 2+ answers map to same pattern → assign that pattern
- If all "None of these" → show full list for self-selection
- Store selected pattern + email in Supabase
- Redirect to /thank-you with pattern result

Make this feel like a real analysis session, not a generic personality quiz.
