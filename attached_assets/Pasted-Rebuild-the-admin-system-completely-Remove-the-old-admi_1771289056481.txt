Rebuild the admin system completely. Remove the old admin panel and god mode system and replace with a clean, modern admin dashboard. Here are ALL the changes:

STEP 1 — REMOVE GOD MODE POLLUTION:

1. In App.tsx: DELETE the URL parameter check for ?godmode=true/false (lines 58-72 area). This causes a double page reload and is not needed.

2. DELETE GodModeBadge.tsx entirely. Remove its import and rendering from App.tsx. It polls localStorage every 1 second on every page — that's wasteful and it shows on every page for no reason.

3. DELETE TestingPanel.tsx entirely. Remove its import and rendering from App.tsx. The floating gear button is unnecessary clutter.

4. Keep the god mode CONCEPT but make it work properly: instead of cosmetic-only, god mode should actually bypass content gates in the portal. Import the hasGodModeAccess function logic directly into the portal/reader components that check purchase tier. If localStorage.godMode === 'true', treat the user as having 'archive' tier access.

5. God mode should ONLY be activatable from the new admin dashboard. No URL params. No floating buttons. No badge on every page.

STEP 2 — REBUILD ADMIN DASHBOARD:

Replace AdminLogin.tsx and AdminDashboard.tsx with a clean, modern admin panel.

ADMIN LOGIN (/admin):
- Dark design matching the rest of the site (#0A0A0A background)
- Centered card, max-width 400px
- "ADMIN" in JetBrains Mono, teal, uppercase
- Simple password field + "Enter" button
- Same button style as the rest of the site (white border, transparent bg)
- On success, redirect to /admin/dashboard

ADMIN DASHBOARD (/admin/dashboard):
- Full dark design (#0A0A0A background)
- Top bar: "THE ARCHIVIST METHOD — ADMIN" in JetBrains Mono, teal, with "Logout" link on the right

- Layout: Left sidebar (200px) + main content area

SIDEBAR NAVIGATION:
- "OVERVIEW" (default view)
- "USERS"
- "CONTENT"
- "SETTINGS"
Each nav item: JetBrains Mono, 13px, uppercase. Active: teal text + teal left border. Inactive: #737373.

OVERVIEW PAGE:
Four stat cards in a 2x2 grid:
- "Total Users" — count of all users
- "Free Tier" — count of crash course users
- "Field Guide ($47)" — count of paid $47 users
- "Complete Archive ($197)" — count of paid $197 users
Each card: glass-morphism style (rgba(255,255,255,0.03) bg, 1px border), number in Playfair Display teal 2.5rem, label in Source Sans 3 #999

Below the stats: "Recent Signups" — last 10 users in a simple table (email, tier, signup date, last active). Clean dark table with subtle row borders.

USERS PAGE:
- Search bar at top (filter by email)
- User table: Email | Tier | Signup Date | Last Active | God Mode | Actions
- Tier shown as colored badge (free=gray, field-guide=teal, archive=pink)
- God Mode: toggle switch per user. When enabled, that user gets full archive access regardless of purchase. Toggle calls the existing PATCH endpoint.
- Actions: "Delete" button (with confirmation dialog)
- "Add Test User" button at top right — opens a simple modal: email input + tier dropdown (free/field-guide/archive) + "Create" button

CONTENT PAGE:
- Shows all content files organized by product tier
- Crash Course section: list of crash course markdown files
- Field Guide section: 9 patterns listed, each expandable to show their content files
- Complete Archive section: all modules listed
- Each item shows: filename, word count, last modified
- Read-only view — this is for auditing content, not editing

SETTINGS PAGE:
- "God Mode" section: Master toggle to enable/disable god mode for YOUR current browser session. Toggles localStorage.godMode. Shows current state.
- "Danger Zone" section: "Clear All Test Users" button with confirmation. Calls DELETE endpoint for each test user.
- "Environment" section: Shows which environment variables are set (SUPABASE_URL, STRIPE keys, etc.) — just green checkmark or red X, don't show actual values.

STEP 3 — CLEAN UP:

1. Remove any references to the old TestingPanel or GodModeBadge in any file
2. Remove any floating gear buttons or pulsing badges
3. Make sure the admin routes are NOT visible to regular users (no links to /admin anywhere in the public site or portal)
4. Admin session uses the existing token-based auth from server/admin/routes.ts
5. All existing API endpoints stay the same — just update the frontend that calls them

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Entire admin panel uses the same dark cinematic design system
- Fonts: Playfair Display (stat numbers, page titles), Source Sans 3 (body text, tables), JetBrains Mono (labels, nav, monospace data)
- Colors: bg #0A0A0A, text #F5F5F5, muted #737373, teal #14B8A6, pink #EC4899
- Cards: rgba(255,255,255,0.03) with 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.06) border
- Buttons: white border style from rest of site
- Tables: clean, minimal, dark rows with subtle borders
- Everything should feel fast, clean, and professional
- No clutter. No unnecessary elements. Every pixel earns its place.
