## SECTION 3: WELCOME

### Page 1: How to Use This Guide

```
HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is not a book you read cover to cover and put on a shelf.

This is a field guide. You take it into the field. You use it when 
the pattern activates. You reference it when you're in the middle 
of the fire, not after.

HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS:

Read the Four Doors Protocol first. Understand the system.

Then go deep on YOUR pattern. That's Section 3. That's where 
you'll spend most of your time. Learn it. Know it. Memorize 
the circuit breaks.

Use the 90-Day Protocol as your structure. It tells you what 
to focus on each week.

When shit hits the fan, go to Crisis Protocols. That's your 
emergency kit.

Track your interrupts. The data matters. Every interrupt—successful 
or not—is information.

The other patterns are there for awareness. You'll recognize 
people in your life. You might recognize yourself. But stay 
focused on YOUR pattern first. Master one before you try to 
master all.


YOU FOUND THE THREAD. NOW PULL IT.
```

### Page 2: The Rules

```
THE RULES

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

RULE 1: ONE PATTERN AT A TIME

You probably have multiple patterns running. Most people do. 
Ignore them for now. This guide is about ONE pattern—yours. 
Master this one first. The others can wait.


RULE 2: PROGRESS, NOT PERFECTION

You will try to interrupt your pattern and fail. The pattern 
will run anyway. That is not failure. That is data.

Write down what happened. What triggered it. How fast it ran. 
That data makes tomorrow better than today.


RULE 3: TRACK JUST ENOUGH

When the pattern activates, write one sentence. What happened. 
Move on.

This is not journaling. This is data collection. You're building 
a map of your own mind.


RULE 4: USE THE CRISIS PROTOCOLS

When you're in the middle of the pattern running, you won't 
remember what to do. That's why the Crisis Protocols exist. 
Bookmark them. Screenshot them. Know where they are.


THE ONLY WAY TO FAIL THIS

Quit before Day 90.

A pattern running on Day 30 is not failure. A pattern running 
on Day 60 is not failure. Closing this PDF and never opening 
it again is failure.

90 days. That's the commitment.
```

### Page 3: What This Is (And What It Isn’t)

```
WHAT THIS IS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is pattern interruption. Behavioral forensics. You have 
a program running. We are going to interrupt it mid-execution.

This is a field guide for people who are tired of understanding 
why and ready to focus on stopping it.

This is the 90-day protocol to take a pattern that has been 
running for years—maybe decades—and break its automatic grip.


WHAT THIS IS NOT

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is not therapy. We are not processing your trauma. We are 
not exploring your inner child. We are not journaling about feelings.

This is not self-help. We are not affirming your worth or teaching 
you to love yourself. That might come later. But that's not the work.

This is not a cure. Patterns don't disappear. They lose power. 
They stop running automatically. But the circuit remains. This 
guide teaches you to catch it before it runs, not to pretend 
it doesn't exist.


THE DIFFERENCE

Therapy explains why the house caught fire.

This teaches you to stop lighting matches.


PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, NOT THERAPY.

## SECTION 4: THE FOUR DOORS PROTOCOL

### Overview Page

```
THE FOUR DOORS PROTOCOL

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Every pattern interruption moves through four doors.

You cannot skip doors. You cannot rush doors. Each one builds 
on the last.

Most people spend their whole lives at Door 1—seeing the pattern, 
hating the pattern, but never moving through the other doors.

This guide walks you through all four.
```

### Door 1: Recognition (2-3 pages)

```
DOOR 1: RECOGNITION

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Before you can interrupt a pattern, you have to see it.

Not after it runs. Not the next day when you're full of regret.
In the moment. As it's activating.

This is harder than it sounds. Patterns are fast. They run in 
3-7 seconds. By the time you realize what's happening, it's 
already happened.

Recognition has three layers:


LAYER 1: THE TRIGGER

Something happens right before your pattern activates. Always.
A word. A tone. A silence. A look on someone's face.

Your job: Identify your top 3 triggers.

You'll map these in Section 3.


LAYER 2: THE BODY SIGNATURE

Before your pattern runs, your body signals it. Every time.
Chest tightness. Stomach drop. Throat closing. Heart racing.

This is the 3-7 second window. The body knows before the 
mind catches up.

Your job: Learn what your body does before the pattern runs.

You'll identify this in Section 3.


LAYER 3: THE THOUGHT

Between trigger and action, there's usually a thought. Fast. 
Almost invisible. But it's there.

"They're going to leave anyway."
"I shouldn't have asked."
"Here we go again."

Your job: Catch the thought.


RECOGNITION COMPLETE WHEN:

You can feel the pattern activating BEFORE it runs. You notice 
the trigger, feel the body signature, and catch the thought.

You don't have to stop it yet. You just have to SEE it.
```

### Door 2: Excavation (2-3 pages)

```
DOOR 2: EXCAVATION

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your pattern didn't come from nowhere.

It installed in childhood. Not because something happened TO 
you—because you learned to DO something to survive.

Excavation is not about blame. It's not about processing. It's 
about understanding where the pattern learned to run.


THE ORIGINAL ROOM

Every pattern has an Original Room. Not a literal room—an 
emotional environment. The place where this pattern made sense.

Maybe closeness led to pain, so you learned to disappear.
Maybe your needs were a burden, so you learned to apologize.
Maybe love was unpredictable, so you learned to test it.

The pattern was a solution once. It kept you safe. It helped 
you survive.

But you're not in that room anymore. And the pattern keeps 
running like you are.


WHY THIS MATTERS

You don't excavate to heal. You excavate to understand why 
the pattern feels so automatic.

When you know where it came from, you stop thinking something 
is wrong with you. You start seeing it as a program that 
installed in a specific environment for a specific reason.

Programs can be rewritten.


EXCAVATION COMPLETE WHEN:

You can name the Original Room. You understand what the pattern 
was protecting you from. You see why it made sense then—and 
why it doesn't now.

You'll do this work in Section 3.
```

### Door 3: Interruption (2-3 pages)

```
DOOR 3: INTERRUPTION

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is the door most people never reach.

They see the pattern (Door 1). They understand it (Door 2). 
But they never learn to STOP it mid-execution.

Interruption is the skill that changes everything.


THE CIRCUIT BREAK

A circuit break is a pre-written script you say when the 
pattern activates. Out loud or in your head.

It interrupts the automatic sequence.

WITHOUT CIRCUIT BREAK:
Trigger → Body signature → Pattern runs (3-7 seconds)

WITH CIRCUIT BREAK:
Trigger → Body signature → CIRCUIT BREAK → Choose different response

The circuit break creates a gap. In that gap, you can choose.


HOW TO USE A CIRCUIT BREAK

1. Feel the body signature
2. Say the script (out loud or in your head)
3. Take one breath
4. Choose a different action

That's it. Simple in concept. Hard in practice.


YOUR CIRCUIT BREAKS

Section 3 contains the circuit break scripts for your specific 
pattern. Multiple scripts for different situations.

Memorize them. Practice them when you're NOT activated. So 
when the moment comes, you have the words ready.


INTERRUPTION COMPLETE WHEN:

You successfully interrupt the pattern at least once. It 
doesn't have to be perfect. It doesn't have to stick. You 
just need ONE successful interrupt to prove the circuit can break.
```

### Door 4: Override (2-3 pages)

```
DOOR 4: OVERRIDE

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

Interruption stops the old pattern.
Override installs a new one.

You cannot just stop a behavior. You have to replace it with 
something. Otherwise the vacuum gets filled by the old pattern 
running again.


THE OVERRIDE PROTOCOL

An override is the new behavior you do INSTEAD of the pattern.

PATTERN: Disappear when someone gets close.
OVERRIDE: Stay and communicate what you're feeling.

PATTERN: Apologize before asking for something.
OVERRIDE: Ask directly without preamble.

PATTERN: Test if they really love you.
OVERRIDE: Ask for reassurance directly.


THE OVERRIDE SCRIPT

Just like circuit breaks, overrides have scripts. Pre-written 
words for the new behavior.

You'll find your override scripts in Section 3.


WHY OVERRIDE IS HARD

The pattern feels natural. The override feels fake.

That's because the pattern has been running for years. Maybe 
decades. It's worn a groove in your brain.

The override is a new path. It feels awkward. Forced. Wrong.

This is normal. You're not being fake. You're being intentional.

Keep running the override. Eventually, it wears its own groove.


OVERRIDE COMPLETE WHEN:

The new behavior starts to feel less forced. You reach for 
the override without having to consciously remember it.

This takes time. Usually somewhere between Day 60-90.

## SECTION 6: THE OTHER PATTERNS

Brief awareness section. 1-2 pages per pattern.

```
THE OTHER PATTERNS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're focused on your pattern right now. Good.

But patterns rarely run alone. As you do this work, you may 
recognize other patterns in yourself—or in people you love.

This section gives you quick identification for all 9 patterns. 
Not mastery. Just awareness.

If you want to go deep on all 9 patterns, the Complete Archive 
has the full archaeology for each.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN

You leave before they can leave you. When relationships get 
close, you feel walls closing in. You ghost, pull away, or 
end things before they can end you.

Signs: Relationships that never get past 3 months. Serial 
almost-relationships. Chronic loneliness despite meeting people.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE APOLOGY LOOP

You apologize for existing. For asking. For needing. You make 
yourself small before anyone can tell you you're too much.

Signs: Starting sentences with "sorry." Minimizing your needs. 
Feeling like a burden. Can't negotiate or set boundaries.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE TESTING PATTERN

You don't ask if they love you—you make them prove it. You 
create tests to see if they'll stay. Most people fail.

Signs: Late-night fights. Loaded questions. Pushing people 
away to see if they'll fight to stay.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

ATTRACTION TO HARM

The safe ones bore you. Red flags feel like chemistry. You 
confuse chaos for connection.

Signs: History of toxic relationships. Good people feel 
"off." Drawn to unavailable or harmful partners.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE DRAINING BOND

You know you should leave. Everyone tells you to leave. You 
stay. Guilt keeps you locked in.

Signs: Years in situations you've outgrown. Can't leave 
without feeling like the bad guy. Slow disappearance of self.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

Praise makes you flinch. You deflect, minimize, explain why 
it wasn't that good. Visibility feels dangerous.

Signs: Career stagnation despite talent. Can't accept 
acknowledgment. Hide your best work.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN

If it's not perfect, it's garbage. So you don't finish. Or 
you don't start. The gap between vision and output paralyzes you.

Signs: Projects that never launch. Ideas that die in your 
head. Endless tweaking instead of shipping.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

SUCCESS SABOTAGE

You get close, then blow it up. Right before the win, you 
pull the pin. You're not afraid of failure—you're afraid of success.

Signs: Pattern of almost-then-not. Destroying things right 
before breakthrough. Self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE RAGE PATTERN

It comes fast. One second fine, next second saying things you 
can't take back. The anger runs you.

Signs: Damaged relationships from words you didn't mean. 
Regret after outbursts. A version of yourself you're ashamed of.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

-----

## SECTION 7: THE 90-DAY PROTOCOL

```
THE 90-DAY PROTOCOL

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is your structure. What to focus on each phase.


PHASE 1: RECOGNITION (Days 1-7)

Focus: See the pattern in real-time.

□ Day 1: Identify your pattern (done—you're here)
□ Day 2: Learn your body signature
□ Day 3: Map your triggers
□ Day 4: Catch the thought
□ Day 5: Practice noticing without stopping
□ Day 6: Track activations (minimum 3)
□ Day 7: Review—what did you learn?

Success metric: You can feel the pattern activate BEFORE it runs.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 2: EXCAVATION (Days 8-30)

Focus: Understand where the pattern came from.

Week 2: The Original Room
□ Where did this pattern install?
□ What was it protecting you from?
□ Who taught you this was necessary?

Week 3: The Function
□ What did this pattern do for you?
□ How did it keep you safe?
□ What would have happened without it?

Week 4: The Cost
□ What has this pattern cost you?
□ Relationships? Opportunities? Health?
□ What do you want back?

Success metric: You understand why the pattern exists—and why it no longer serves you.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 3: INTERRUPTION (Days 31-60)

Focus: Break the circuit.

Week 5-6: Circuit Break Practice
□ Memorize your primary circuit break
□ Practice it 3x daily (not just when activated)
□ Use it in low-stakes situations first

Week 7-8: Live Interruption
□ Use circuit break in real activations
□ Track outcomes: AUTO / PAUSE / REWRITE
□ Refine based on what works

Success metric: At least ONE successful interrupt where you chose a different behavior.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 4: OVERRIDE (Days 61-90)

Focus: Install new behavior.

Week 9-10: Override Practice
□ Identify your override behavior
□ Practice override scripts
□ Use override after successful interrupts

Week 11-12: Integration
□ Override becomes more automatic
□ Notice when old pattern tries to return
□ Reinforce new pathway

Week 13: Review + What's Next
□ What changed in 90 days?
□ What still needs work?
□ Other patterns to address?

Success metric: Override feels less forced. New behavior is becoming default.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

Use the tracking templates in the next section.

Log every activation. Every interrupt attempt. Every override.

The data shows you what's working.
```

-----

## SECTION 8: CRISIS PROTOCOLS

```
CRISIS PROTOCOLS

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

For when the pattern runs anyway. For when you're in the 
middle of it and can't think straight. For the morning after.


WHEN THE PATTERN IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW

Stop. Read this.

1. You are not your pattern. The pattern is running through 
   you. But it is not you.

2. You noticed. That matters. Most people don't even see it.

3. You have a choice right now. Not a perfect choice. But 
   a choice.

Say this out loud:

"The [PATTERN NAME] just activated. I feel it in my 
[body signature]. I am choosing to pause before I act."

Take 3 breaths. Slow.

Now: What is ONE different thing you can do right now? Not 
the perfect thing. Just a different thing.

Do that.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

EMERGENCY CIRCUIT BREAKS

When you can't remember your scripts, use these:

"This is the pattern. Not me. The pattern."

"I can feel it running. I'm going to pause."

"I don't have to do what the pattern wants right now."

"What would I do if the pattern wasn't running?"

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHEN THE PATTERN ALREADY RAN

It happened. You did the thing. Now what?

DO NOT:
- Spiral into shame
- Decide you're broken
- Give up on the process

DO:
- Write down what happened (one paragraph)
- Identify the trigger
- Note when you first felt the body signature
- Ask: Where could I have interrupted?

This is data. Not failure. Data.

The pattern ran for years before you started this work. It 
doesn't stop in a week. Every time it runs, you learn something.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE MORNING AFTER PROTOCOL

You woke up and remembered what happened. The shame is heavy.

1. Get out of bed. Shower. Eat something.

2. Open this guide. Read your pattern section.

3. Write: "The pattern ran. I noticed. I'm still here. Today 
   is a new data point."

4. Do ONE thing from your 90-day protocol today.

That's it. You don't have to fix everything. You just have 
to keep going.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT

The pattern might tell you this doesn't work. That you're 
too broken. That you should give up.

That's the pattern talking.

Patterns don't want to be interrupted. They fight back. 
Wanting to quit IS the pattern trying to protect itself.

Read this:

"Quitting is the pattern winning. I don't have to be perfect. 
I just have to keep going. One more day. One more interrupt 
attempt. That's all."

If you're thinking about quitting, you're closer than you 
think. The pattern is fighting because it's losing.

Keep going.

Mark each day you engaged with the protocol.

## SECTION 10: WHAT’S NEXT

```
WHAT'S NEXT

─────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have what you need to master this pattern.

The Field Guide. The 90-day protocol. The crisis protocols. 
The tracking templates.

This is enough to change your life.

But patterns rarely run alone.


WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR MORE

The Complete Archive contains:

• Full deep dives on all 9 patterns
• Pattern combinations (when you run more than one)
• Relationship protocols (how patterns interact with partners)
• Workplace applications (patterns at work)
• Parenting contexts (breaking the cycle)
• Advanced interruption techniques
• Lifetime updates as the method evolves

You don't need it now. Focus on YOUR pattern first.

But when you're ready—when you've tasted what interruption 
feels like and you want the full picture—the Archive is there.
