Three critical fixes. Apply in order. Do not skip any.

FIX 1 — PATTERN CARDS TEXT:
The pattern card descriptions have double/overlapping text 
rendering. This is a CSS animation artifact. Fix now:

Find all pattern card elements. Remove any text-shadow 
glitch effects, any pseudo-element (::before, ::after) 
that duplicates text content, any translateX animation 
on text inside cards. 

Each card description must render as clean single text only.
No effects on the description copy whatsoever.

FIX 2 — CREDIBILITY STATS SECTION:
Current: plain teal numbers on black. Weak.

Replace entirely with this treatment:

Section background: subtle teal fog at 3% opacity
Four stats in a row, each stat block:

Stat number: Schibsted Grotesk 900, 80px desktop 56px 
mobile, white, no color

Stat label: JetBrains Mono, 12px, #666, spaced caps

Add one heavy dividing line above the stats in teal at 
1px opacity 0.3

Add this copy above the stats row:
Label: "THE SYSTEM" — JetBrains Mono pink 11px spaced
Headline: "BUILT AROUND ONE THING." — Schibsted Grotesk 
900 white 48px desktop 36px mobile
Subhead: "The moment before you do it again." — Libre 
Baskerville italic teal 22px

Stats remain: 4 FEIR Doors, 9 Documented Patterns, 
3-7 Second Window, 24/7 Pocket Archivist

Below stats add one line in Libre Baskerville italic 
teal 18px:
"Every component exists for one purpose — to give you 
what you need in the 7 seconds that decide everything."

FIX 3 — BENTO "THIS IS WHAT YOU GET":
This section is not working. Rebuild it completely.

Remove "THIS IS WHAT YOU GET" as the headline. 
Replace with:

Section label: "INSIDE THE ARCHIVE" — JetBrains Mono 
pink 11px spaced caps

Headline: "FOUR TOOLS. ONE WINDOW." — Schibsted Grotesk 
900 white 56px desktop 40px mobile all caps

Subhead: "Everything in this system was built for the 
moment the pattern fires." — Libre Baskerville italic 
teal 20px

Four bento panels in 2x2 grid desktop, stacked mobile:

PANEL 1 — largest, top left, teal border:
Label: "YOUR PATTERN DASHBOARD" — JetBrains Mono pink
Title: "THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN" bold white
Body: "Your pattern documented in full. Body signature 
mapped. Trigger sequence identified. Yours permanently."
Small detail line: "Chest tightness — active • 12 day 
streak" in JetBrains Mono #666 small

PANEL 2 — top right, subtle border:
Label: "THE POCKET ARCHIVIST" — JetBrains Mono pink
Title: "IT ALREADY KNOWS." bold white
Simulated chat bubble dark background:
User bubble right: "I just ghosted her again"
Archivist response left teal border: "Disappearing 
pattern. What did you feel in your chest right before 
you pulled away?"
Below in #666 small: "Not a chatbot. A precision tool."

PANEL 3 — bottom left, subtle border:
Label: "BODY SIGNATURE MAP" — JetBrains Mono pink
Title: "YOUR BODY KNEW FIRST." bold white
Body: "Tightness (Chest) • Drop (Stomach) • Cold (Hands)"
Subtitle: "Your pattern has a physical signal. The 
method teaches you to read it before it executes."
Simple body silhouette with three teal dots at chest, 
stomach, hands

PANEL 4 — bottom right, subtle border:
Label: "THE INTERRUPT PROTOCOL" — JetBrains Mono pink
Title: "CIRCUIT BREAK." bold white
Teal label: "DISAPPEARING PATTERN"
Quote in italic: "The pattern is running. I feel the 
tightness. I'm choosing to stay."
Progress bar teal: "Day 11 of 90"
Body: "A trained sequence. Not a thought. Not a reframe. 
A practiced physical response that fires before the 
pattern executes."

All panels: dark background #111, subtle border #1a1a1a, 
16px border radius, generous padding 32px desktop 24px 
mobile. Teal glow on panel 1 border only.
