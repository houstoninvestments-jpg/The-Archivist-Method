Add these 5 atmospheric upgrades across the site:

1. LIVE SYSTEM LOG FOOTER:
Replace the static footer closing line with a live-updating system log. Create 15-20 fake log entries that cycle through randomly, showing one new line every 3 seconds. Each line fades in, pushes the previous line up, and the oldest line fades out. Max 3 visible lines at a time.

Style: JetBrains Mono, 11px, #444. Timestamps in #555. Pattern names in teal. Numbers in pink.

Example entries (create 15-20 variations mixing these formats):
"[14:22:01] Pattern identified: THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN — Case #4,271"
"[14:22:05] Circuit break applied. Interrupt confirmed — User #8,821"
"[14:22:11] Archive synced. 12,847 loops interrupted to date."
"[14:22:14] Body signature detected: chest tightness — Pattern: APOLOGY LOOP"
"[14:22:19] Field Guide accessed — Case #3,092 — Day 34 of 90"
"[14:22:23] Successful interrupt logged — TESTING PATTERN — 3.2 second window"
"[14:22:28] New pattern identified: SUCCESS SABOTAGE — Case #5,118"
"[14:22:31] Circuit break: 'I don't need to destroy this.' — Interrupt held."
"[14:22:35] Workbench activated — Brain dump in progress — User #6,440"
"[14:22:39] Pattern weakening detected — DRAINING BOND — Week 6 of protocol"
"[14:22:42] Archive entry created — COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION — Body signature: throat closing"
"[14:22:46] 3-7 second window caught — RAGE PATTERN — Interrupt applied at 2.8 seconds"
"[14:22:50] Crash Course completed — Pattern: PERFECTIONISM TRAP — Case #7,203"
"[14:22:54] Cross-pattern analysis: DISAPPEARING + TESTING — correlation 0.84"
"[14:22:58] Streak update: 31 consecutive days — ATTRACTION TO HARM — User #2,119"

The timestamps should use the user's actual current time (new Date()), incrementing by random 2-5 seconds. The log entries cycle randomly with no repeats until all have shown.

Place this above the copyright line and footer links. Give it a subtle top border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.05).

The overall effect should feel like you're watching a live intelligence system processing pattern data globally.

2. MICRO-COORDINATES ON SECTIONS:
Add small "dossier metadata" strings in the top-right corner of sections 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 (gut check, patterns, 3-7 window, how it works, credibility bar).

Style: JetBrains Mono, 9px, rgba(255,255,255,0.12), position absolute, top 16px, right 24px.

Each section gets a unique string:
- Gut check: "SECTOR 01 // EMOTIONAL SCAN // STATUS: ACTIVE"
- 9 Patterns: "ARCHIVE REF: 09-CORE // CLASSIFICATION: PRIMARY"
- 3-7 Window: "TEMPORAL ANALYSIS // WINDOW: 3.2-6.8s // THRESHOLD: ACTIVE"
- How it works: "PROTOCOL: FEIR-4 // CLEARANCE: STANDARD"
- Credibility bar: "DATASET: 685 PAGES // PATTERNS: 9 // CONFIDENCE: 0.97"

These should be barely noticeable — discovered, not displayed. Someone who notices them thinks "wow, the attention to detail." Someone who doesn't notice isn't distracted.

On mobile: hide these completely (display: none under 768px). They're a desktop detail.

3. BACKGROUND EVOLUTION ON SCROLL:
Add a subtle background texture that evolves as the user scrolls down the page.

Top of page (hero through gut check): Add a very subtle CSS noise/grain overlay. Use a repeating tiny SVG pattern or CSS background-image noise at 3-5% opacity. This creates a "raw, unprocessed" feel.

Middle of page (patterns through comparison table): The grain fades out. A very subtle teal grid pattern fades IN at 2-3% opacity. Thin lines, 80px spacing. This suggests "the system is organizing the chaos."

Bottom of page (pricing through footer): Both grain and grid fade out completely. Pure clean #0A0A0A. Maximum whitespace. The archive is organized. The method is clear.

Implementation: Use CSS background-image layers with opacity transitions tied to scroll position (use the same --scroll-progress CSS variable from the thread animation). The transitions should be very gradual — the user shouldn't consciously notice the shift, just feel it.

4. QUIZ RESULTS GLITCH EFFECT:
When the quiz finishes calculating the pattern result, add a 0.3 second "digital glitch" effect before revealing the result.

The effect: For 0.3 seconds, the screen shows:
- 2-3 horizontal "scanlines" (thin white lines at random Y positions, 1px height, full width, 20% opacity)
- The result text scrambles through random characters rapidly (like a slot machine resolving) — cycle through random letters for 0.3s then resolve to the actual pattern name
- A very brief screen flash (the background goes to #111 for 50ms then back to #0A0A0A)

After the 0.3s glitch, the result appears cleanly with the pattern name and match percentage.

The effect should feel mechanical and intentional — like the system just processed something heavy. NOT like the site is broken. Keep it very brief and controlled.

Use CSS keyframes for the scanlines and a simple JavaScript string scramble for the text. No external libraries.

5. SKELETON BLUEPRINT LOADING:
When the landing page first loads, instead of a blank screen or flash of unstyled content, show a skeleton loading state for 0.5-1 seconds that looks like a wireframe blueprint.

The skeleton shows:
- Rectangles where text will be (rgba(255,255,255,0.03) background, subtle pulse animation)
- The rectangles are sized to match the actual content (wide rectangle for headline, narrower for subtext, button-shaped rectangle for CTA)
- A very subtle teal line traces the outline of the layout (like watching a blueprint being drawn)
- After 0.5-1s, the skeleton fades out and the real content fades in

This should only show on initial page load, not on scroll or navigation. Use CSS animations only, no JavaScript timers for the skeleton itself.

The effect: It looks like you're watching the archive construct itself before your eyes. It adds "weight" to the experience.

All 5 upgrades should be implemented without breaking any existing content, layout, routing, or functionality.
