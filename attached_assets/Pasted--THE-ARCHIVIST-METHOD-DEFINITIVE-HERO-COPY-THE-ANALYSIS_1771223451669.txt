# THE ARCHIVIST METHOD — DEFINITIVE HERO COPY

## THE ANALYSIS

**Who lands on this page:**
Someone who just blew up a relationship, ghosted someone they love, sabotaged something that was working, or apologized for existing for the 50th time today. They’re coming from a short-form video that called out their exact behavior. They’re curious, scared, and tired. They’ve probably done therapy. They understand WHY they do it. They just can’t stop DOING it.

**What they need to feel in 5 seconds:**
“Holy shit, this person sees me. This is different from everything else I’ve tried. There might actually be a way to stop.”

**What they need to understand in 10 seconds:**
This isn’t therapy. This isn’t self-help. This is a specific system that interrupts destructive patterns in real-time using your body’s own warning signals.

**The core problem TAM solves:**
Understanding why you do something destructive doesn’t stop you from doing it. Therapy gives you the why. TAM gives you the interrupt.

**The mechanism that makes it credible:**
The 3-7 second window. Your body signals the pattern before it runs. Learn the signal, catch the window, interrupt the behavior. That’s the whole method.

## THE HERO — PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT:

```
Completely rewrite the hero section of the landing page with this exact copy and structure. Keep the same dark cinematic design, Playfair Display headlines, Source Sans 3 body, JetBrains Mono monospace accents. Keep the particle animation. Keep the white-border CTA button style.

LAYOUT (top to bottom, all centered, generous vertical spacing):

LINE 1 — Brand name
THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™
Style: JetBrains Mono, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.3em, teal (#14B8A6), font-size 14px

LINE 2 — The hook (main headline)
You know exactly what you're doing.
You just can't stop.
Style: Playfair Display, white (#F5F5F5), font-size: 4.5rem desktop / 2.5rem mobile, font-weight 700, line-height 1.15

LINE 3 — The positioning statement
The first pattern interruption system that works in real-time — not in retrospect.
Style: Source Sans 3, muted (#999), font-size 1.15rem, max-width 580px, margin-top 32px

LINE 4 — The mechanism (what makes it different)
Your body warns you 3-7 seconds before every destructive pattern runs. Therapy never taught you to listen. This does.
Style: Source Sans 3, white (#F5F5F5), font-size 1.05rem, max-width 540px, margin-top 24px

LINE 5 — CTA Button
FIND YOUR PATTERN →
Style: JetBrains Mono, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.15em, white border, transparent background, padding 18px 48px, font-size 15px. Hover: white background, black text. Links to /quiz

LINE 6 — Trust line
Free · 2 Minutes · Instant Results
Style: Source Sans 3, muted (#737373), font-size 13px, margin-top 16px

LINE 7 — Tagline
Pattern archaeology, not therapy.
Style: JetBrains Mono, teal (#14B8A6), font-size 12px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.2em, margin-top 48px, opacity 0.7

SPACING:
- Hero section should be full viewport height (100vh)
- Content vertically centered
- Generous padding on all sides
- The headline should dominate — everything else supports it
- Let the darkness breathe around the text

MOBILE:
- Headline scales to 2.5rem
- All text remains centered
- CTA button goes full-width with 16px horizontal margin
- Maintain the same vertical rhythm but with tighter spacing

DO NOT add any images, icons, or decorative elements. The typography IS the design. The darkness IS the aesthetic. Let the words sit in space.
```

## WHY THIS WORKS:

**Line 1 (Brand):** Establishes what this is. First-time visitors now see the name.

**Line 2 (Hook):** “You know exactly what you’re doing. You just can’t stop.” — This is the EXACT internal dialogue of the target customer. It’s not clever. It’s not poetic. It’s the truth they’ve never seen on a website before. It creates instant recognition: “this person understands my problem.”

**Line 3 (Positioning):** “The first pattern interruption system that works in real-time — not in retrospect.” — This positions TAM as a new category. Not therapy (retrospect). Not self-help (vague). A SYSTEM that works in REAL-TIME. This is the differentiator. Nobody else says this.

**Line 4 (Mechanism):** “Your body warns you 3-7 seconds before every destructive pattern runs.” — This is the credibility line. It’s specific (3-7 seconds). It’s biological (your body). It names what therapy missed (never taught you to listen). And it promises what TAM delivers (This does). A cold visitor now understands HOW this works.

**Line 5 (CTA):** “FIND YOUR PATTERN” — Not “take a quiz.” Not “learn more.” FIND YOUR PATTERN. It implies there’s something to discover about yourself. That’s curiosity-driven, not sales-driven.

**Line 6 (Trust):** Removes friction. Free, fast, immediate.

**Line 7 (Tagline):** Reinforces the category. “Pattern archaeology, not therapy” is the brand line that sticks in someone’s head after they leave.

## THE CONVERSION LOGIC:

Second 1-3: “You know exactly what you’re doing. You just can’t stop.” → RECOGNITION (they feel seen)
Second 3-5: “The first pattern interruption system that works in real-time” → CURIOSITY (what is this?)
Second 5-8: “Your body warns you 3-7 seconds before…” → CREDIBILITY (this is specific and scientific)
Second 8-10: “FIND YOUR PATTERN →” → ACTION (I need to know mine)

Total time from landing to clicking: under 15 seconds.

That’s a converting hero.
