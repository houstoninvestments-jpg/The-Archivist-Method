**PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, NOT THERAPY**

---

THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™ | CLASSIFIED

---

## WHAT THIS IS

You have a pattern destroying your life.

You already bought the programs. You did Day 1. Maybe Day 2. Then it joined the graveyard in your downloads folder.

You're here because something different needs to happen.

This is that something.

---

### THIS IS NOT THERAPY

We're not processing your trauma. We're not exploring your feelings. We're not journaling about your inner child.

This is pattern interruption. Behavioral forensics. You have code running. We're going to interrupt it mid-execution.

Therapy explains why the house is on fire. This teaches you how to stop lighting matches.

---

### WHAT YOU'RE HERE TO DO

One pattern. 90 days. By Day 90:

- Pattern activates 50-70% less frequently
- When it activates, you catch it within seconds
- You interrupt it more than it runs you
- It no longer controls your life

That's it.

---

### HOW THIS GUIDE WORKS

**Section 1:** Identify which pattern is running  
**Section 2:** The 90-Day Protocol (the actual work)  
**Section 3:** Circuit Break Library (pre-written scripts)  
**Section 4:** Original Room Excavation (where it installed)  
**Section 5:** Tracking Instructions  
**Section 6:** Crisis Protocols  
**Section 7:** Relationship Scripts  

Pick one pattern. Work the protocol. Everything else is reference material.

# SECTION 1: PATTERN ASSESSMENT

## IDENTIFY YOUR PRIMARY PATTERN

You run multiple patterns. You can only fix one at a time.

This assessment finds your primary—the one causing the most damage right now.

---

## THE 7 CORE PATTERNS

Read all seven. Pick the one that made your stomach drop.

---

### 1. THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN

Someone says "I love you." Your chest gets tight. You ghost them by Tuesday.

**What it looks like:** Pulling away when relationships get close. Ghosting. Creating distance when someone wants more. Ending things before they can end you.

**What it costs you:** Can't maintain relationships past 3 months. Chronic loneliness. Serial almost-relationships.

---

### 2. THE APOLOGY LOOP

Sorry to bother you. Sorry, quick question. Sorry, I know you're busy. Sorry for existing.

**What it looks like:** Constant apologizing. Minimizing your needs. Feeling like a burden. Can't ask for things directly.

**What it costs you:** Can't negotiate salary. Can't state boundaries. People walk over you because you trained them to.

---

### 3. THE TESTING PATTERN

You pick fights at 11pm to see if they'll still be there at breakfast. You push them away to see if they'll fight to stay.

**What it looks like:** Creating tests to prove people care. Picking fights to check loyalty. Pushing people away to see if they come back.

**What it costs you:** Exhaust partners. Push away people who care. Self-fulfilling abandonment prophecy.

---

### 4. ATTRACTION TO HARM

The nice guy feels boring. The unavailable one feels like chemistry. Red flags feel like attraction, not warning.

**What it looks like:** Attracted to unavailable or harmful people. Safe people feel boring. Confusing chaos for chemistry.

**What it costs you:** Serial toxic relationships. Can't stay attracted to healthy partners. The good ones feel wrong.

---

### 5. COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

Boss says "nice work." You say "oh, it was nothing, anyone could have done it." They stop complimenting you.

**What it looks like:** Can't accept praise. Minimize achievements. Self-deprecating jokes when acknowledged. Visibility triggers panic.

**What it costs you:** Career stagnation. Underpaid despite talent. Invisible to people who could help you. Passed over for promotion.

---

### 6. THE DRAINING BOND

You know you should leave. Your friends tell you. Your therapist tells you. You stay.

**What it looks like:** Staying bonded to harmful people or situations. Knowing you should leave but can't. Guilt when thinking about leaving.

**What it costs you:** Years in toxic jobs or relationships. Chronic depletion. Watching your life pass while staying stuck.

---

### 7. SUCCESS SABOTAGE

Three weeks from launching. Everything's going well. You stop working. Or pick a fight with your business partner. Or miss the deadline.

**What it looks like:** Destroying things right before they succeed. Quitting before breakthrough. Can't tolerate sustained success or happiness.

**What it costs you:** Pattern of almost-success then failure. Perpetual struggle. Watching people with less talent succeed because they can tolerate it.

# SECTION 2: THE 90-DAY PROTOCOL

## YOUR PATTERN INTERRUPTION ROADMAP

Four phases:

**Weeks 1-3:** OBSERVATION (notice, don't change)  
**Weeks 4-5:** PAUSE (create gap between trigger and behavior)  
**Weeks 6-8:** CIRCUIT BREAK (verbal interruption)  
**Weeks 9-12:** REWRITE (new behavior)

---

## WEEKS 1-3: OBSERVATION PHASE

### OBJECTIVE

Pattern recognition without judgment.

### THE WORK

Track every activation. Note trigger, body sensation, automatic thought, behavior.

Do NOT try to change anything yet.

### WHY

Most people skip this. They try to change immediately. Then they can't recognize pattern activation fast enough to interrupt it.

You need to train recognition first.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

Identify pattern within 10 seconds of activation by end of Week 3.

---

## WHAT TO TRACK

### 1. TRIGGER

What happened right before pattern activated.

**Examples:**
- Disappearing: Partner said "I love you"
- Apology Loop: Needed to ask for help
- Testing: Partner took 3 hours to text back
- Attraction to Harm: Safe person showed interest
- Compliment Deflection: Boss praised your work
- Draining Bond: Friend said you should leave
- Success Sabotage: Approaching milestone

---

### 2. BODY SIGNATURE

Physical feeling 3-7 seconds before automatic behavior.

- Chest tightness
- Stomach drop
- Throat closing
- Heart racing
- Nausea
- Panic
- Dread
- "Something bad is coming"

---

### 3. AUTOMATIC THOUGHT

What your mind says.

- Disappearing: "This is too much" / "I need to get out"
- Apology Loop: "I'm being a burden"
- Testing: "They're going to leave anyway"
- Attraction to Harm: "Finally, someone exciting"
- Compliment Deflection: "They don't mean it"
- Draining Bond: "I can't abandon them"
- Success Sabotage: "I don't deserve this"

---

### 4. BEHAVIOR

What you did automatically.

- Disappearing: Pulled away, canceled plans, went silent
- Apology Loop: Apologized before asking
- Testing: Picked fight, created test
- Attraction to Harm: Pursued red flag person
- Compliment Deflection: Made joke, deflected to others
- Draining Bond: Stayed when you should have left
- Success Sabotage: Quit, created crisis, self-destructed

---

## HOW TO TRACK

**Phone notes:** Simple, fast, always available.  
**Voice memos:** ADHD-friendly. Just speak what happened.  
**Paper tracker:** See bonus download.  
**Spreadsheet:** For data people.

Pick one. Use it.

---

## WEEK-BY-WEEK EXPECTATIONS

### WEEK 1

You forget to track. Normal.

You catch pattern AFTER it runs. "Oh shit, that was the pattern."

**Success:** Recognizing activation within 1-2 minutes.

---

### WEEK 2

Recognition speed increases. Catch it within 30 seconds.

You start feeling body signature BEFORE automatic behavior executes.

**Success:** Feeling the body sensation and recognizing "pattern is about to run."

---

### WEEK 3

Pattern recognition becomes automatic. Body sensation = instant recognition.

**Success:** Identify pattern within 10 seconds. Ready for interruption phase.

---

THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™ | CLASSIFIED

---

## WEEKS 4-5: PAUSE PHASE

### OBJECTIVE

Create a gap between trigger and behavior.

### THE WORK

When pattern activates, PAUSE for 10 seconds.

Just pause. Don't do anything else.

Count to 10. Breathe. Then track.

### WHY

Patterns run automatically:

Trigger → Sensation → Thought → Behavior (3-7 seconds total)

You need to slow that down. The pause creates space.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

30% of activations include a 10-second pause.

---

## THE 10-SECOND PAUSE

1. STOP whatever you're about to do
2. COUNT to 10 (out loud or in head)
3. BREATHE (doesn't have to be deep)
4. THEN decide what to do

The goal is NOT to stop the pattern yet. The goal is to CREATE A GAP.

---

### WEEK 4 EXPECTATIONS

Pause feels impossible. Pattern runs too fast. You try to pause AFTER behavior executes.

**Success:** Pause BEFORE automatic behavior 20% of the time.

---

### WEEK 5 EXPECTATIONS

Pause becomes slightly easier. You catch pattern earlier in the sequence.

30-40% of activations include a pause.

**Success:** Pause happening 30%+. Ready for circuit break.

---

THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™ | CLASSIFIED

---

## WEEKS 6-8: CIRCUIT BREAK PHASE

### OBJECTIVE

Add verbal interruption statement.

### THE WORK

When pattern activates: Pause AND say circuit break statement.

Out loud or in your head.

THEN track.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

40% of activations include circuit break statement.

---

## CIRCUIT BREAK STATEMENTS

### DISAPPEARING

"The Disappearing Pattern just activated. I feel [chest tightness/panic/urge to flee]. The program wants me to pull away. I am choosing to stay and communicate instead."

---

### APOLOGY LOOP

"I'm about to apologize for [existing/asking/needing]. I have done nothing wrong. I am replacing 'sorry' with 'thank you.'"

---

### TESTING

"The Testing Pattern activated. I want to test if they really care. I am not creating a test. I am asking directly instead."

---

### ATTRACTION TO HARM

"I feel chemistry with this person. Let me check: are they safe or familiar? This is pattern recognition, not love. I am choosing not to pursue."

---

### COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

"Someone just complimented me. I want to deflect. I am saying only: Thank you. No deflection. No minimization."

---

### DRAINING BOND

"I know I should leave this [relationship/job/situation]. I'm staying out of pattern, not love or necessity. Leaving is self-preservation, not betrayal."

---

### SUCCESS SABOTAGE

"I'm approaching [milestone/success]. Success Sabotage is activating. This is the pattern, not reality. I am allowed to succeed. I am continuing forward."

---

## WEEKS 6-8 EXPECTATIONS

### WEEK 6

Circuit break feels awkward. You forget to say it. When you say it, pattern still executes.

### WEEK 7

Circuit break starts happening more automatically. 30% of activations include it.

### WEEK 8

40%+ of activations include circuit break. Pattern grip is loosening.

**Success:** Circuit break becoming automatic response to pattern activation.

---

THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™ | CLASSIFIED

---

## WEEKS 9-12: REWRITE PHASE

### OBJECTIVE

Execute new behavior more often than automatic behavior.

### THE WORK

Pause + Circuit Break + NEW BEHAVIOR.

The new behavior is the Rewrite.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

Execute Rewrite more often than you execute automatic behavior. 51%+.

---

## REWRITES BY PATTERN

### DISAPPEARING PATTERN

**Automatic:** Pulling away, creating distance, canceling plans  
**Rewrite:** Stay. Communicate fear instead of disappearing.

**Example:**
- Partner says "I love you"
- Pattern activates (chest tightness, urge to flee)
- Pause + Circuit break
- Stay in the moment
- Say: "I love you too. And I'm scared. This is new for me. Can we go slow?"

---

### APOLOGY LOOP

**Automatic:** "Sorry to bother you, but..."  
**Rewrite:** "Thank you for your time. Can you help me with X?"

**Example:**
- Need to ask boss for help
- Pattern activates (guilt, feeling like burden)
- Pause + Circuit break
- Replace "sorry" with "thank you"
- Say: "Thank you for making time. I need help with [specific thing]."

---

### TESTING PATTERN

**Automatic:** Creating test (picking fight, pushing away)  
**Rewrite:** Ask directly for reassurance.

**Example:**
- Partner takes 3 hours to text back
- Pattern activates (panic, "they're leaving")
- Pause + Circuit break
- Don't create test
- Say: "I noticed you took a while to respond and I felt scared. Can you reassure me you're still here?"

---

### ATTRACTION TO HARM

**Automatic:** Pursuing red flag person / staying attracted to chaos  
**Rewrite:** Choose safe person even if they feel "boring."

**Example:**
- Meet someone with obvious red flags, feel strong chemistry
- Pattern activates (excitement, "finally someone interesting")
- Pause + Circuit break
- List the red flags explicitly
- Don't pursue
- Give safe person a chance even if chemistry isn't instant

---

### COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

**Automatic:** Deflecting ("Oh, it was nothing" / self-deprecating joke)  
**Rewrite:** Say "Thank you" only.

**Example:**
- Boss: "Great work on that project"
- Pattern activates (discomfort, want to minimize)
- Pause + Circuit break
- Say: "Thank you."
- Say nothing else. No deflection. No minimization.

---

### DRAINING BOND

**Automatic:** Staying in toxic relationship/job/situation  
**Rewrite:** Make plan to leave. Execute plan.

**Example:**
- Know you should leave abusive relationship
- Pattern activates (guilt, "I can't abandon them")
- Pause + Circuit break
- Make actual plan: Date to leave, where you'll go, support you'll need
- Execute plan despite guilt

---

### SUCCESS SABOTAGE

**Automatic:** Quitting before success, creating crisis, self-destructing  
**Rewrite:** Continue forward despite panic.

**Example:**
- Approaching promotion/90 days sober/relationship milestone
- Pattern activates (dread, "something bad is coming")
- Pause + Circuit break
- Do the next right thing anyway
- Don't quit. Don't sabotage. Keep going.

---

## WEEKS 9-12 EXPECTATIONS

### WEEK 9

Rewrite execution starts. 30% of the time. Pattern still wins most of the time.

### WEEK 10

Rewrite happening 40%. You can feel pattern weakening.

### WEEK 11

50-60% Rewrite rate. You execute new behavior MORE than automatic behavior.

### WEEK 12

60-70% Rewrite rate. Pattern still activates but you interrupt it consistently.

**Success:** Pattern significantly weaker. Interruption becoming your new automatic response.

---

THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™ | CLASSIFIED

---

## DAY 90: WHAT TO EXPECT

The pattern is not dead. It's weakened.

**What "weakened" means:**
- Activates 50-70% less frequently
- When it activates, intensity is lower
- You catch it faster
- You interrupt it more often than you execute it
- It no longer controls your life

Pattern interruption is not pattern elimination. It's pattern management.

You're learning to interrupt code that's been running 10, 20, 30+ years. 90 days weakens it significantly.

Continue the work. It gets easier.

# SECTION 3: CIRCUIT BREAK LIBRARY

## PRE-WRITTEN SCRIPTS FOR ALL 7 PATTERNS

Copy these. Paste them in your phone. Say them verbatim when pattern activates.

---

## DISAPPEARING PATTERN SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: FOR ROMANTIC PARTNERS

"I need to tell you something. When we get close—like when you say 'I love you' or we make future plans—I feel panic. This is my Disappearing Pattern. It installed when I was younger and intimacy led to abandonment. It makes me want to pull away even though you're safe. I'm working on interrupting it. If you notice me creating distance, you can say 'Is the pattern running?' That helps me catch it. I'm not leaving. I'm just scared."

---

### SCRIPT 2: MID-ACTIVATION

"I'm feeling my pattern right now. I want to cancel our plans / pull away / create distance. This is the Disappearing Pattern, not reality. You haven't done anything wrong. Can I have 10 minutes alone to regulate? I'll come back."

(Then actually come back in 10 minutes.)

---

### SCRIPT 3: AFTER YOU'VE DISAPPEARED

"I disappeared on you. That was my pattern running. I pulled away because intimacy triggered my nervous system, not because you did anything wrong. I'm sorry for the confusion and hurt this caused. I'm working on catching this earlier. Next time, I'll tell you when I'm feeling the urge to disappear instead of just doing it."

---

## APOLOGY LOOP SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: REPLACING "SORRY" WITH "THANK YOU"

**Instead of:** "Sorry to bother you..."  
**Say:** "Thank you for your time..."

**Instead of:** "Sorry for needing help..."  
**Say:** "Thank you for helping me with this..."

**Instead of:** "Sorry I'm so needy..."  
**Say:** "Thank you for being patient with me..."

---

### SCRIPT 2: WHEN ASKING FOR WHAT YOU NEED

"I need [specific thing]. This is hard for me to ask because my pattern makes me feel like a burden. But I'm working on stating my needs without apologizing. Can you [specific request]?"

---

### SCRIPT 3: WHEN SOMEONE SAYS "STOP APOLOGIZING"

"You're right. I apologize automatically because of a pattern I'm working on. I'll try to catch it. If you hear me apologize for something that doesn't warrant an apology, you can remind me."

---

## TESTING PATTERN SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: INSTEAD OF CREATING A TEST

"I'm feeling insecure right now. My pattern wants me to test if you really care by [pushing you away / picking a fight / creating drama]. I'm not doing that. Instead, I'm asking directly: Are you still here? Are we okay?"

---

### SCRIPT 2: WHEN YOU'VE ALREADY CREATED A TEST

"I just tested you. I [picked that fight / pushed you away / said something harsh] because my Testing Pattern activated. I was scared you were going to leave, so I tested if you'd stay through conflict. This wasn't fair to you. You've shown me you're consistent. I'm working on trusting that without creating tests."

---

### SCRIPT 3: FOR NEW RELATIONSHIPS

"I want to tell you about something I'm working on. I have a Testing Pattern where I push people away to see if they'll stay. You might see me create unnecessary conflict or pull away when things are going well. This isn't about you. It's my nervous system checking if you're safe. If this happens, the best response is to stay consistent but also call it out: 'Are you testing me right now?' That helps me recognize it."

---

## ATTRACTION TO HARM SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE WITH RED FLAGS

"I feel strong chemistry with this person. Let me check: Do they match my pattern? Red flags: [list them]. This feels exciting because it's FAMILIAR harm, not because it's healthy. I'm choosing not to pursue this person."

---

### SCRIPT 2: WHEN SAFE PERSON FEELS BORING

"This person is safe, consistent, and available. My pattern says they're 'boring' because there's no chaos. I'm going to give this 3 months before deciding. Attraction to safety can be built. Attraction to harm is instant but destructive."

---

### SCRIPT 3: AFTER CHOOSING HARMFUL PERSON AGAIN

"I chose the harmful person again. I recognized the red flags and pursued anyway. This is my Attraction to Harm pattern. I'm attracted to familiar dysfunction, not love. Next time, I will pause 48 hours before pursuing anyone I feel instant chemistry with."

---

## COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: WHEN COMPLIMENTED

**"Great work on that project."**  
"Thank you." (Stop there. Say nothing else.)

**"You're so talented."**  
"Thank you." (No deflection. No joke.)

**"I'm proud of you."**  
"Thank you." (Just accept it.)

---

### SCRIPT 2: IN PERFORMANCE REVIEWS / SALARY NEGOTIATIONS

"Thank you for the feedback. I'd like to discuss a raise based on my performance. Specifically: [List 3-5 achievements without minimizing them]. Based on this and market rates, I'm requesting [specific number]."

---

### SCRIPT 3: WHEN LISTING ACHIEVEMENTS

**Instead of:** "Helped with project that increased revenue"  
**Say:** "Led project that increased revenue by 40%"

**Instead of:** "I just did what anyone would do"  
**Say:** "I identified the problem and implemented solution X, which resulted in Y"

---

## DRAINING BOND SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: WHEN DECIDING TO LEAVE

"I've stayed in this [relationship/job/situation] past the point I should have left. I'm bonded to this out of pattern, not love or necessity. Leaving is self-preservation, not betrayal. I'm making a plan to leave by [specific date]."

---

### SCRIPT 2: WHEN OTHERS TELL YOU TO LEAVE

"I know you're telling me to leave because you care about me. You're right that this situation is harmful. I'm working on my Draining Bond pattern that keeps me here. I'm making a plan. I'll need your support when I execute it."

---

### SCRIPT 3: WHEN GUILT TRIES TO PULL YOU BACK

"I feel guilty for leaving. The guilt is my pattern telling me I'm abandoning someone who needs me. But staying is destroying me. My job is to save myself, not sacrifice myself."

---

## SUCCESS SABOTAGE SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: WHEN APPROACHING MILESTONE

"I'm at [90 days sober / promotion approaching / relationship going well]. I feel [panic / dread / 'something bad is coming']. This is Success Sabotage. The pattern wants me to destroy this before external disaster does. But there is no disaster coming. This is safe. I'm allowed to succeed. I'm continuing forward."

---

### SCRIPT 2: WHEN YOU WANT TO QUIT

"I want to quit right now. I want to blow this up. I want to self-destruct. This is the pattern activating at the exact moment of potential breakthrough. I'm not quitting. I'm calling my support person. I'm waiting 48 hours before making any decision."

---

### SCRIPT 3: AFTER YOU'VE SABOTAGED

"I sabotaged [relationship / job / sobriety / achievement]. I destroyed it right when it was going well. This was Success Sabotage. I couldn't tolerate sustained goodness. Next time, I will [specific prevention plan]. I'm not giving up on the work."

# SECTION 4: ORIGINAL ROOM EXCAVATION

## FINDING WHERE YOUR PATTERN WAS INSTALLED

Every pattern has an origin point—the Original Room where it was installed.

Usually childhood. Sometimes adulthood from severe trauma.

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS

Understanding origin helps you:

1. See it's not random—it made sense at the time
2. Differentiate THEN (when pattern was necessary) from NOW (when it's not)
3. Thank the pattern for protecting you when you had no other options
4. Release its function (you have other tools now)

You don't need to process the Original Room. You don't need to heal from it. You just need to know it exists.

---

## THE EXCAVATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: NAME THE BEHAVIOR

What does your pattern make you do?

**Example (Disappearing):** "When someone gets close, I pull away without explanation"

YOUR ANSWER: _______________________________________________

---

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE BODY SIGNATURE

What physical sensation happens RIGHT BEFORE the automatic behavior?

**Example:** Chest tightness, urge to flee, throat closing

YOUR ANSWER: _______________________________________________

---

### STEP 3: FIND THE ORIGINAL ROOM

Close your eyes. Remember the FIRST TIME you felt this exact body signature + automatic thought combination.

Don't force it. If a memory comes, it comes. If not, work with survival logic instead (Step 4).

- How old were you?
- Where were you?
- Who was there?
- What was happening?
- What did you need that you didn't get?

---

### STEP 4: UNDERSTAND THE SURVIVAL LOGIC

In that Original Room, what would have happened if you DIDN'T develop this pattern?

**Example:** "If I didn't pull away, I would have stayed attached to my mother who left suddenly. The pain would have destroyed me. Pulling away protected me from attachment that led to abandonment."

The pattern's job: Protect you from a threat you had no other way to handle.

YOUR ANSWER: _______________________________________________

---

### STEP 5: WRITE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT LETTER

"Dear [Pattern Name],

You were installed when I was [age] during [event/situation]. At that time, you protected me from [threat]. If you hadn't existed, I would have [consequence]. Thank you for keeping me safe when I had no other options.

I'm [current age] now. The threat that created you no longer exists. I have [resources/skills/support] now that I didn't have then. I don't need you to protect me the same way anymore.

I'm working on interrupting you. This doesn't mean you were wrong. It means circumstances have changed.

Thank you for your service. I'm taking it from here."

---

### STEP 6: THEN VS NOW

| THEN (Original Room) | NOW (Current Reality) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Age: ___ | Age: ___ |
| Threat: ___ | Threat level: ___ |
| Resources: None | Resources: ___ |
| Could leave? No | Can leave? ___ |
| Had to survive | Can choose differently |

---

## EXCAVATION EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1: DISAPPEARING PATTERN

**Age:** 8  
**Original Room:** Parents divorced suddenly. Father left without warning.  
**Survival Logic:** "If I don't get attached, I won't be destroyed when they leave."  
**Automatic Behavior:** Create distance before abandonment happens.

**Why it made sense:** Father's sudden departure was catastrophic. No warning. No control. Attachment = devastation.

**Why it doesn't fit now:** Partners are not father. I can recognize red flags. I can leave if needed. I have agency. Closeness ≠ guaranteed abandonment.

---

### EXAMPLE 2: APOLOGY LOOP

**Age:** 5-10  
**Original Room:** Youngest of 4 kids. Mother overwhelmed. Father absent.  
**Survival Logic:** "If I'm not a burden, maybe they'll have capacity for me."  
**Automatic Behavior:** Minimize needs to be manageable.

**Why it made sense:** Needs really were "one more thing" for exhausted mother. Being small = being loved.

**Why it doesn't fit now:** Partner/friends/boss are not overwhelmed mother. My needs are normal. I'm not competing for scraps of attention.

---

### EXAMPLE 3: SUCCESS SABOTAGE

**Age:** 12  
**Original Room:** Won academic award. Narcissistic parent couldn't tolerate child's success. Punished for achieving.  
**Survival Logic:** "If I don't succeed visibly, I won't be punished."  
**Automatic Behavior:** Stay small to stay safe.

**Why it made sense:** Success literally led to punishment. Staying small was actual safety.

**Why it doesn't fit now:** Boss/partner are not narcissistic parent. My success doesn't threaten them. Achievement is safe now.

---

## IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ORIGINAL ROOM

Reasons this happens:
- Age (pattern installed before age 5 = limited memory)
- Dissociation (trauma blocked the memory)
- Cumulative trauma (no single event, just ongoing environment)

You can still interrupt the pattern without remembering the specific Original Room.

Work with the survival logic:

"This pattern exists because at some point, it protected me from something. Even if I don't remember the specific moment, I can understand: [pattern behavior] made sense as survival mechanism. It no longer fits my current reality."

# SECTION 5: TRACKING INSTRUCTIONS

## WHAT TO TRACK, HOW TO TRACK, WHEN TO TRACK

---

## THE 4 ESSENTIAL DATA POINTS

### 1. TRIGGER

What happened right before pattern activated.

Be specific:
- ✗ "Partner was distant"
- ✓ "Partner took 3 hours to text back"

---

### 2. BODY SIGNATURE

Physical feeling before automatic behavior.

- Chest tightness
- Stomach drop
- Throat closing
- Heart racing
- Nausea
- Hypervigilance
- Shakiness
- Dread

---

### 3. AUTOMATIC THOUGHT

The story your pattern tells:

- Disappearing: "This is too much"
- Apology Loop: "I'm a burden"
- Testing: "They're going to leave"
- Attraction to Harm: "Finally someone exciting"
- Compliment Deflection: "They don't mean it"
- Draining Bond: "I can't abandon them"
- Success Sabotage: "I don't deserve this"

---

### 4. BEHAVIOR

What you did.

- AUTO = Executed automatic behavior
- REWRITE = Interrupted successfully

---

## HOW TO TRACK

### METHOD 1: PHONE NOTES

Simple format:

```
Date: 12/6
Trigger: Partner said ILY
Body: Chest tight
Thought: Too much
Behavior: AUTO (pulled away)
```

**Pro:** Always available, fast, private  
**Con:** Easy to forget

---

### METHOD 2: VOICE MEMOS

Just speak what happened:

"Okay, pattern activated. Partner just said they love me, I felt chest tightness, thought 'this is too much,' and I pulled away. That's AUTO. Moving on."

**Pro:** Fastest method, no writing  
**Con:** Need to transcribe later if you want data

---

### METHOD 3: PRINTABLE TRACKER

Paper template you can print. See bonus download.

**Pro:** Tactile, satisfying to fill in  
**Con:** Have to carry it, can lose it

---

### METHOD 4: SPREADSHEET

Columns: Date, Trigger, Body, Thought, Behavior (AUTO/REWRITE), Notes

**Pro:** Trackable metrics, graphs possible  
**Con:** More complex, not fast

---

## WHEN TO TRACK

### OPTION 1: IMMEDIATELY AFTER ACTIVATION (RECOMMENDED)

Track within 5 minutes of pattern activating.

**Pro:** Most accurate  
**Con:** Might not always be possible

---

### OPTION 2: END OF DAY REVIEW

At night, recall all activations from that day.

**Pro:** Less disruptive to daily life  
**Con:** Memory less accurate

---

### OPTION 3: VOICE MEMO DURING, TRANSCRIBE LATER

Record what's happening in the moment. Transcribe nightly.

**Pro:** Captures real-time data without slowing down  
**Con:** Requires extra step

---

## TRACKING TIPS

**Missed a day?** Start again next day. Don't spiral.

**When to stop daily tracking?** 90 days is the protocol. After that, switch to weekly reviews.

**Apology Loop people:** You might feel guilty about tracking ("I'm being too obsessive").

Circuit break: "Tracking my pattern is not obsessive. It's data collection. I'm allowed to work on myself."

**For ADHD:**
- Use voice memos (easiest)
- Track weekly instead of daily ("This week pattern activated approximately X times")
- Have accountability partner text you daily: "Did you track today?"

**Minimum tracking goals:**
- Week 1: Track 3-4 days minimum
- Week 2: Track 5-6 days minimum
- Week 3-12: Track 6-7 days per week

Missing days is normal. Quitting forever is failure. Keep starting again.

# SECTION 6: CRISIS PROTOCOLS

## WHAT TO DO WHEN PATTERN CAUSES MAJOR DAMAGE

---

## CRISIS PROTOCOL 1: 5-MINUTE EMERGENCY INTERRUPT

**USE WHEN:** Pattern activated, you're spiraling, can't think clearly.  
**TIME:** 5 minutes

---

### STEP 1: STOP EVERYTHING (60 SECONDS)

Set timer for 60 seconds.

Do nothing. Move to different location if possible. Just exist for 60 seconds.

---

### STEP 2: NAME THE PATTERN (30 SECONDS)

Say out loud or write down:

"The [pattern name] just activated."

Don't know which pattern? Just say: "A pattern just activated."

---

### STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE DAMAGE (60 SECONDS)

Write one sentence:

"What I just did:" _______________  
"The damage is:" _______________

---

### STEP 4: DELAY FURTHER DAMAGE (SET TIMER FOR 2 HOURS)

I will not make this worse for 2 hours.

No more texts. No more calls. No more decisions. No more automatic behaviors. Just 2 hours of pause.

---

### STEP 5: EMERGENCY CONTACT (90 SECONDS)

Text or call ONE person:

"My [pattern] just ran. I did [behavior]. I'm using emergency protocol. I need to not be alone for 2 hours. Can you talk/text with me?"

No support person? Text Crisis Text Line: HOME to 741741

---

## CRISIS PROTOCOL 2: SUICIDAL IDEATION FROM PATTERN ACTIVATION

**WARNING:** If you have plan and means, call 988 or 911 NOW. Don't use this protocol.

**USE WHEN:** Passive suicidal thoughts triggered by pattern damage ("I want to die because I ruined everything again")

---

### WHY PATTERNS TRIGGER SUICIDAL THOUGHTS

When pattern causes major damage, your brain says:

"I did it again. I'll never change. Everyone would be better off without me."

The pattern WANTS you to believe you're unfixable. If you're dead, pattern doesn't have to change.

Suicidal ideation after pattern activation = pattern's last-ditch effort to avoid interruption.

---

### EMERGENCY INTERRUPT STEPS

**STEP 1: NAME IT**

Say out loud:

"I'm having suicidal thoughts because my pattern just ran. This is not evidence I should die. This is the pattern trying to protect itself."

---

**STEP 2: DELAY THE DECISION**

"I don't have to decide about dying right now. I can choose to die tomorrow. But not today. Just 24 hours."

Set timer for 24 hours.

---

**STEP 3: CALL SUPPORT**

988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)

Or text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line)

Say: "I'm having suicidal thoughts after a pattern activation. I'm not in immediate danger but I need to talk."

---

**STEP 4: PHYSICAL INTERRUPT**

Do something that requires your body to focus:

- 50 jumping jacks
- Cold shower (as cold as you can stand for 60 seconds)
- Hold ice in hands until it melts
- Run around the block

Physical intensity interrupts thought spiral.

---

**STEP 5: CONTACT SUPPORT PERSON**

Text or call your designated person:

"I'm having suicidal thoughts. Pattern just ran. I'm not going to act on it, but I need to not be alone right now. Can you talk or come over?"

---

## CRISIS PROTOCOL 3: RELATIONSHIP DESTRUCTION EMERGENCY

**USE WHEN:** Pattern just destroyed a relationship (or is about to)

---

### IF IT JUST HAPPENED:

**STEP 1: STOP TALKING**

Do not try to explain while dysregulated. You will make it worse.

---

**STEP 2: REQUEST TIME**

"I need [X hours] to calm down and think clearly. I'm not abandoning this conversation. I will reach out at [specific time]. I'm sorry for [specific behavior you did]."

Then actually follow through.

---

**STEP 3: REGULATE**

5-4-3-2-1 grounding:
- 5 things you see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you hear
- 2 things you smell
- 1 thing you taste

Repeat until you can think clearly.

---

**STEP 4: DOCUMENT**

Write this down:
- Which pattern ran?
- What was trigger?
- What did I do automatically?
- What damage did it cause?

---

**STEP 5: REPAIR LATER**

You will repair this. But not right now.

When you're calm (6-24 hours later), use repair script from Section 7.

---

### IF IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN:

You feel pattern activating. You're about to blow up the relationship.

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**

Say out loud to your partner:

"I need to tell you something. My pattern is activating right now. I feel [physical sensation]. The pattern wants me to [automatic behavior]. I don't want to do that. Can I take 10 minutes and come back?"

Then leave room. Set timer for 10 minutes. Regulate. Return.

---

## CRISIS PROTOCOL 4: RELAPSE EMERGENCY (ADDICTION)

**USE WHEN:** About to relapse (or just relapsed) and spiraling

---

### IF YOU HAVEN'T USED YET:

**STEP 1:** Set timer for 15 minutes  
**STEP 2:** Do not use before timer expires  
**STEP 3:** Call sponsor: "I'm about to relapse. Pattern is running. Talk me through this."  
**STEP 4:** Leave location where substance is  
**STEP 5:** Go to meeting (in-person or online)

Often, urgency decreases in 15 minutes. If still urgent after 15:
- Set timer for another 15
- Repeat

**Goal:** Delay long enough for compulsion to decrease.

---

### IF YOU JUST RELAPSED:

**STEP 1: DO NOT SHAME SPIRAL**

Shame will make you use more.

---

**STEP 2: STOP NOW**

Do not use again right now. One use ≠ week-long binge.

---

**STEP 3: CALL SUPPORT**

Call sponsor/therapist/support person:

"I just relapsed. I used [substance]. I'm not using again today. I need support."

---

**STEP 4: DATA COLLECTION**

When slightly more stable, write:

- Trigger: What happened right before urge?
- Pattern: Which pattern activated? (Success Sabotage? Draining Bond?)
- Circuit break failure: Where did my interruption fail?

This is data, not evidence you're hopeless.

---

**STEP 5: RESTART IMMEDIATELY**

Do not wait days or weeks to "get back on track."

Start tracking again TODAY. Relapse is part of pattern interruption process.

---

**STEP 6: REDESIGN INTERRUPT**

Whatever you tried didn't work this time.

Design new one:
- Stronger delay (30 minutes instead of 15)
- Different support person
- Different physical intervention
- Different environment removal strategy

---

# SECTION 7: RELATIONSHIP COMMUNICATION SCRIPTS

## HOW TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PATTERNS

---

## SCRIPT 1: TELLING A PARTNER ABOUT YOUR PATTERN (FIRST TIME)

**When to use:** Early in relationship, things getting serious.

"I want to talk to you about something important. It's about how I sometimes react in relationships.

I run a pattern called [pattern name]. What that means is: when [trigger], I automatically [behavior].

This pattern was installed when I was younger during [brief Original Room—only if you want to share]. At that time, it kept me safe by [survival logic].

This pattern is not about you. You're safe and you've shown me that. But my nervous system doesn't know that yet. Sometimes it will react as if you're [childhood threat], even though you're not.

When this pattern runs, it might look like: [specific behaviors they'll see].

What would help me: if you notice me [pattern behavior], you can say '[specific phrase like "Is the pattern running?"]' and that helps me recognize it. Then I can tell you what I'm feeling instead of just doing the automatic behavior.

I'm working on interrupting this. It will happen less over time. I just wanted you to know what you might see and that it's not about you."

---

## SCRIPT 2: REPAIR AFTER PATTERN DAMAGED RELATIONSHIP

**When to use:** Pattern ran, hurt partner, need to repair.

"I need to talk about what happened. I [specific behavior—disappeared/tested you/picked fight/etc.]. That hurt you and damaged your trust in me.

This was my [pattern name]. When [trigger happened], my nervous system interpreted it as [threat], even though you're safe. Instead of communicating that, I [automatic behavior].

I should have told you what I was feeling. That's on me. I'm responsible for managing my pattern, even though it runs automatically.

I'm working on interrupting this pattern. Specifically, next time [trigger] happens, I will [specific circuit break/Rewrite].

To repair the damage, I will [specific action if appropriate]. Is there anything else you need from me?"

---

## SCRIPT 3: MID-ACTIVATION (PREVENTING DAMAGE)

**When to use:** Pattern activating RIGHT NOW, want to interrupt before damage.

"I need to pause this conversation. My [pattern] is activating. I feel [body sensation—chest tight/panic/etc.]. The pattern wants me to [automatic behavior—pull away/pick fight/test you/etc.].

I don't want to do that. Can I have [10 minutes/an hour] to regulate? I'll come back and we can finish this conversation. I'm not abandoning it."

(Then actually come back in specified time.)

---

## SCRIPT 4: WHEN PARTNER TRIGGERS YOUR PATTERN (NOT MALICIOUSLY)

**When to use:** Partner did something normal, your pattern activated.

"When you [specific thing they did], my pattern activated. I know you didn't mean anything by it. But my nervous system interpreted it as [threat from childhood].

What I need: [specific request]. Can you [do this differently/reassure me/give me space/etc.]?"

**Example:**

"When you went out with friends without texting, my Testing Pattern activated. I know you're allowed to have a life. But my nervous system interpreted silence as abandonment. What I need: A quick text when you're out just saying 'hey, having fun, see you later.' Can you do that?"

---

## SCRIPT 5: WHEN PARTNER IS UNSAFE (WEAPONIZING YOUR PATTERN)

**When to use:** Partner uses your pattern against you, mocks it, or triggers it intentionally.

**Red flags:**
- "You're just running your pattern" (dismissing legitimate concerns)
- Mocking your vulnerability
- Intentionally triggering pattern
- Using pattern knowledge to manipulate you

**Script:**

"I shared my pattern with you so you could understand me better, not so you could use it against me. When you [specific behavior—mock it/dismiss my concerns by blaming pattern/trigger it intentionally], that's abuse.

A safe partner supports my growth. An unsafe partner weaponizes my wounds.

This needs to stop immediately, or I need to reconsider if this relationship is safe for me to do pattern work in."

---

## SCRIPT 6: ENLISTING PARTNER'S SUPPORT

**When to use:** Want partner to help you recognize pattern activation.

"I'm working on interrupting my [pattern]. Sometimes I can't see when it's running. Would you be willing to help me catch it?

If you notice me [pattern behavior], you can say: '[agreed-upon phrase like "Is the pattern running?" or "Circuit break?"]'

That's not criticism. That's support. It helps me recognize the pattern faster so I can interrupt it. Are you comfortable doing that?"

---

## SCRIPT 7: WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE PATTERN DETAILS

**When to use:** Early relationship, not ready to explain full pattern history.

"I'm working on some behavioral patterns from my past. Sometimes I might [specific behavior you know they'll see]. It's not about you. It's something I'm interrupting. I'll tell you more about it when I'm ready. For now, I just wanted you to know that if you see me do that, it's my pattern, not your fault."

---

## SCRIPT 8: ASKING FOR PATIENCE DURING 90-DAY PROTOCOL

**When to use:** Beginning protocol, want partner to know this is temporary intensity.

"I'm starting a 90-day pattern interruption protocol. For the next 90 days, I'm going to be tracking my [pattern] and working on interrupting it.

You might notice me:
- Pausing mid-conversation
- Asking for reassurance more than usual
- Naming my pattern out loud
- Seeming more self-aware of my reactions

This is me doing the work. It will be intense for 90 days, then it gets easier. I'd appreciate your patience while I work through this."

---

## SCRIPT 9: WHEN PARTNER HAS PATTERNS TOO

**When to use:** Both of you run patterns, want to support each other.

"We both have patterns. I have [your pattern], you have [their pattern]. Sometimes our patterns trigger each other.

What if we created a system: When either of us notices a pattern running—ours or the other person's—we can say 'Pattern check' and pause the interaction. No blame, just recognition.

Then we can name which pattern is running and decide how to handle it together. Does that work for you?"

---

## SCRIPT 10: BOUNDARIES AROUND PATTERN WORK

**When to use:** Partner is too involved in your pattern work, or not respecting your process.

"I appreciate that you want to help me with my pattern work. But I need you to understand:

I'm responsible for managing my pattern, not you.

You can support me by [specific thing], but you can't fix me.

When you [specific behavior—constantly point out my pattern/try to manage my tracking/etc.], it feels like [criticism/control/etc.].

What I need from you is: [specific boundary]."

# CONCLUSION: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 90 DAYS

The pattern is weaker. It still exists.

---

## YOUR OPTIONS AFTER 90 DAYS

### OPTION 1: CONTINUE 90 MORE DAYS (SAME PATTERN)

- Deepen the work on same pattern
- Get to 80-90% interruption rate
- Strengthen the Rewrite

---

### OPTION 2: MAINTENANCE MODE

- Track weekly instead of daily
- Monthly check-ins
- Pattern still activates occasionally but manageable

---

### OPTION 3: START NEW PATTERN

- Use same 90-Day Protocol
- Apply what you learned from first pattern

---

### OPTION 4: COMBO

- Maintenance on primary
- Start work on secondary
- Deepen as needed

---

## MAINTENANCE MODE (After 90 Days)

### WEEKLY CHECK-IN

End of each week:
- How many times did pattern activate?
- How many successful Rewrites?
- Any new triggers identified?
- Adjustments needed?

### MONTHLY REVIEW

- Compare to 30 days ago
- Overall trajectory?
- Pattern intensity changes?
- Life improvements?

---

## WHEN PATTERNS REACTIVATE AFTER MONTHS/YEARS

It happens. Extreme stress, anniversary of trauma, new relationship that mirrors childhood—pattern can reactivate after being dormant.

**What to do:**

1. "Oh, [pattern] is back."
2. "I've interrupted this before. I can do it again."
3. Return to basics: Same circuit breaks that worked before
4. Adjust as needed: You're different now. Update Rewrites.

---

## FINAL WORDS

The goal is not pattern elimination. The goal is pattern management.

Weak enough is good enough.

The pattern will still activate. But you'll catch it faster. Interrupt it more often. It won't control your life anymore.

That's the work.
