Add a new quiz page to my existing project at route /quiz. Create a mobile-optimized, 15-question diagnostic quiz with Framer Motion animations. One question card at a time, full screen. When option clicked: current card slides LEFT, new card slides RIGHT. Spring animation: stiffness 300, damping 30. All buttons in bottom 40% of screen. Progress bar at top (bg-indigo-500).
