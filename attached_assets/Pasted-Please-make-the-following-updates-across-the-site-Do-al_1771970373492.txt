Please make the following updates across the site. Do all of them in one pass.

**1. QUIZ — ADD NEUTRAL OPTION**
Add a 'This doesn't apply to me' option to every quiz question so users who don't identify with a pattern aren't forced into a false answer.

**2. QUIZ — LOADING SCREEN**
Add a loading screen between quiz submission and results. Sequential fade-in lines, 1.5 seconds apart, teal accent, dark background:

Line 1: Scanning 9 behavioral patterns...
Line 2: Cross-referencing your response signature...
Line 3: Identifying your primary loop...
Line 4: Checking for secondary reinforcement patterns...
Line 5: Your Archivist file is being compiled...

Final hold: 'Your pattern has a name. And a way out.'
Subtle teal progress bar at bottom. Minimum 6 seconds display time. Never skip this screen.

**3. QUIZ RESULTS PAGE — FULL REDESIGN**
Match homepage design exactly — dark background, teal accents, same fonts and card styles.

Section 1 — The Reveal: Pattern name in large teal type. 2-3 sentences of deeply personal behavioral/emotional language describing their pattern. End with: 'You've been running this pattern longer than you think. And there's a reason it still works on you.'

Section 2 — Breadcrumbs: 3 dark bento-style cards. No solutions, just recognition:
- What triggers this pattern
- What it costs them emotionally
- Why willpower hasn't worked
Teal icons or accent lines. Warm and knowing tone, not clinical.

Section 3 — The Gate:
Headline: 'The pattern has a name. The exit has a door.'
Subhead: 'Your free Crash Course walks you through the first step of the FEIR method — built specifically for your pattern.'
Email input + button: 'Send Me The First Step'
Small text below: 'No sales sequence. Just the work.'

**4. PORTAL — UPDATE TO MATCH**
Update the portal/crash course page to match the same homepage design language — dark background, teal accents, same typography and card styles. It should feel like a seamless continuation of the quiz results experience, not a separate product.

**Design rules for everything above:**
- Mobile first
- Match homepage exactly
- Emotional tone: warm, knowing, not clinical
- No confetti, no generic messaging
- Every screen should feel like the same coherent experience
