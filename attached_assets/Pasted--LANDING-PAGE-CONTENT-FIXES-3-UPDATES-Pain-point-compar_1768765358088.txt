LANDING PAGE CONTENT UPDATES - 3 FIXES

Location: Homepage / Landing page sections

---

FIX #1: COMPARISON TABLE - PAIN POINT FOCUSED
==============================================

Issue: Current comparison is good but could hit pain points harder

Current comparison:
- Therapy vs The Archivist Method
- Generic differences
- Doesn't emphasize the visceral pain points

Required: Make it HURT. Make readers see their own patterns.

NEW COMPARISON TABLE:

Section header:
"Pattern Archaeology, Not Therapy"
Subheader: "What makes The Archivist Method™ different"

Table structure (keep the dark card design, teal/pink colors):

Column 1: THERAPY
Column 2: THE ARCHIVIST METHOD™

Row 1:
Therapy: "Processes trauma"
Archivist: "Interrupts patterns trauma created"

Row 2:
Therapy: "Takes years"
Archivist: "7-90 days to see results"

Row 3:
Therapy: "Talk about childhood"
Archivist: "Find Original Room, then interrupt"

Row 4:
Therapy: "Insight-focused"
Archivist: "Behavior-focused"

Row 5:
Therapy: "$200/session ongoing"
Archivist: "$47-$197 one-time"

Row 6 (NEW - PAIN POINT):
Therapy: "You understand why you do it"
Archivist: "You stop doing it"

Row 7 (NEW - PAIN POINT):
Therapy: "Explores the pattern"
Archivist: "Interrupts the pattern"

Row 8 (NEW - VISCERAL):
Therapy: "Validates your feelings"
Archivist: "Maps your body signature"

Styling notes:
- Keep Therapy column in muted gray/white
- Keep Archivist column in TEAL/PINK (brand colors)
- Bold the pain-point rows (6, 7, 8)
- Make sure mobile: table scrolls or stacks cleanly

---

FIX #2: REMOVE ALL BETA/EARLY LANGUAGE
========================================

Issue: Beta perks section feels corny, unnecessary, creates artificial urgency

DELETE ENTIRELY:
- "YOU'RE EARLY TO THIS" section
- "BETA LAUNCH PERKS" heading
- "Available through February 28, 2026" deadline
- "If you're one of the first 100..." copy
- All beta tester benefits/perks
- "This isn't about discounts..." copy
- Any mention of "beta"
- Any mention of "early access"
- Any mention of "founding members"

Replace with: NOTHING (just remove it)

Why: 
- The method stands on its own value
- Beta language creates discount expectations (brand violation)
- "First 100" creates false scarcity (off-brand)
- Premium product doesn't need "early access" positioning
- You're not begging for beta testers, you're offering pattern interruption

If there's a CTA button in that section, keep the CTA but move it:

Move this button:
"Take the Assessment - Start Free 7-Day Course →"

To: Right after the comparison table

New section after comparison:
```html
<section class="cta-section">
  <h2>Stop Running the Pattern</h2>
  <p>Take the 2-minute assessment.</p>
  <p>Get your 7-day protocol.</p>
  <p>Start breaking the cycle today.</p>
  
  <button class="cta-primary">
    Take the Free Assessment →
  </button>
  
  <p class="cta-subtext">
    Free • Private • No Email Required • Instant Results
  </p>
</section>
```

---

FIX #3: ADD FOUNDER TEASER (MINIMAL & MYSTERIOUS)
=================================================

Issue: Need credibility without victim narrative, mysterious without corny

Location: Add new section BEFORE footer, AFTER final CTA

Section: "Built in Survival Mode"

Content:
```html
<section class="founder-teaser">
  <div class="founder-content">
    <h2>BUILT IN SURVIVAL MODE</h2>
    
    <p>
      The Archivist Method was built in December 2025. Not in a lab. 
      Not with funding. Not from stability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Homeless. Failing laptop. Van for workspace. Coding between bartending shifts. 
      Running out of AI credits at 2am. Choosing credits over food.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Built while actively running every pattern it interrupts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Because survival mode is when you see the code clearest.
    </p>
    
    <p class="founder-tagline">
      If it works here, it works anywhere.
    </p>
    
    <p class="founder-signature">
      — The Archivist
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Styling:
```css
.founder-teaser {
  background: #0a0a0a;
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.1);
  border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.1);
  padding: 80px 20px;
  margin: 80px 0;
}

.founder-content {
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: center;
}

.founder-teaser h2 {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-size: 28px;
  font-weight: 700;
  color: #14B8A6;
  letter-spacing: 2px;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
}

.founder-teaser p {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-size: 17px;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #94A3B8;
  line-height: 1.7;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.founder-tagline {
  font-size: 19px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: #ffffff;
  margin-top: 32px;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
}

.founder-signature {
  font-style: italic;
  color: #6B7280;
  font-size: 15px;
}

@media (max-width: 640px) {
  .founder-teaser h2 {
    font-size: 22px;
  }
  
  .founder-teaser p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  
  .founder-tagline {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}
```

Why this works:
- ✅ Mysterious (no name, no full story)
- ✅ Credible (specific details: homeless, van, laptop, credits, food)
- ✅ Not victim ("built anyway" frame, not "poor me")
- ✅ Validates method (if it works under pressure, it works)
- ✅ Intriguing (leaves you wanting more)
- ✅ On-brand (direct, clinical, not emotional)

What it DOESN'T say:
- ❌ Names (Carissa, Stephanie, kids)
- ❌ Full story (eviction details, restraining order)
- ❌ Sob story ("I was suffering...")
- ❌ Victim frame ("despite my circumstances...")
- ❌ Inspirational ("I overcame...")

What it DOES say:
- ✅ Built in survival mode (context)
- ✅ Specific constraints (homeless, van, credits)
- ✅ Choice framing ("choosing credits over food")
- ✅ Pattern validation ("built while running patterns")
- ✅ Results focus ("if it works here, it works")

- [ ] "BETA LAUNCH PERKS" heading
- [ ] "(Available through February 28, 2026)" deadline
- [ ] "If you're one of the first 100 to complete the crash course:" box
- [ ] "If you buy Quick-Start or Archive before March 1:" box
- [ ] All beta tester benefits lists
- [ ] "This isn't about discounts..." copy
- [ ] Any artificial deadline copy
- [ ] Any "founding member" language

KEEP but MOVE:
- [ ] "Take the Assessment - Start Free 7-Day Course" button
     → Move to right after comparison table

---

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

After all 3 fixes:

Comparison Table:
- [ ] 8 rows (not 5)
- [ ] Pain points hit hard ("You understand why" vs "You stop doing it")
- [ ] Brand colors consistent (Teal/Pink for Archivist column)
- [ ] Mobile: Table scrolls or stacks cleanly

Beta Language:
- [ ] Global search for "beta" returns ZERO results
- [ ] Global search for "early" returns ZERO results (except in founder teaser "You're early" if kept)
- [ ] No artificial deadlines anywhere
- [ ] No "first 100" language
- [ ] No perks/benefits lists

Founder Teaser:
- [ ] Located before footer, after final CTA
- [ ] "BUILT IN SURVIVAL MODE" heading in teal
- [ ] Mysterious (no names)
- [ ] Not victim frame
- [ ] Specific details (van, laptop, credits, food)
- [ ] On-brand voice (direct, clinical)
- [ ] Mobile: Readable, centered

Overall:
- [ ] Page flows smoothly without beta section
- [ ] No gaps or weird spacing where beta was removed
- [ ] CTAs still prominent
- [ ] Brand consistent throughout
- [ ] No corny language anywhere
