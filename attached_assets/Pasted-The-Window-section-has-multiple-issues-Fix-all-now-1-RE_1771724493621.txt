The Window section has multiple issues. Fix all now.

1. REMOVE COMPLETELY:
- All glitch effects on any text across the entire page
- All glitch CSS and JavaScript
- The detective board section and all its code
- Any remaining animation from the old 3-7 second window component
- Any Intersection Observer animations that are causing lag
- Clean up all unused code and imports after deletion

2. REBUILD THE WINDOW SECTION FROM SCRATCH:
Pure static typography. Zero JavaScript. CSS fade-in on scroll only using CSS animation-timeline or simple opacity transition. Nothing else moves.

Structure:
- Section label: "THE WINDOW" JetBrains Mono pink 13px spaced caps
- Massive padding top and bottom on each line
- Each line fades in as it enters viewport using CSS only

Lines in order with exact styling:
"YOUR BODY KNEW." — Schibsted Grotesk 900, white, 52px mobile 72px desktop, all caps
"Before the thought formed. Before the words came out. Before you did the thing you swore you wouldn't do again." — Libre Baskerville italic, teal #14B8A6, 20px mobile 24px desktop
"3 TO 7 SECONDS." — Schibsted Grotesk 900, white, 64px mobile 96px desktop, all caps
"That's the gap between the signal and the pattern executing. It exists in every person. In every pattern. Every single time." — Source Sans 3, white #F5F5F5, 18px
"WILLPOWER LIVES IN THE THINKING PART OF YOUR BRAIN." — Schibsted Grotesk 900, white, 36px mobile 48px desktop, all caps
"Your pattern fires from the survival part. You've been bringing a spreadsheet to a knife fight." — Libre Baskerville italic, teal, 20px mobile 24px desktop
"THE ARCHIVIST METHOD TEACHES YOU WHAT TO DO INSIDE THAT WINDOW." — Schibsted Grotesk 900, white, 36px mobile 48px desktop, all caps

3. PAGE-WIDE ANIMATION CLEANUP:
Remove all Intersection Observer scroll animations that trigger on every pixel scroll. Replace with simple CSS:
@keyframes fadeIn { from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(20px); } to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); } }
Apply to sections with animation-play-state controlled by a simple .visible class added once when element enters viewport. Fire once, never again.

4. LOADING:
Add a simple page fade-in on load. Body starts at opacity 0, transitions to 1 over 400ms on DOMContentLoaded. Nothing else.

5. REPUBLISH after all changes confirmed.
