The /thank-you page needs a major redesign. It looks too generic and "template-y". I need it to feel premium, professional, and punchy.

PROBLEMS TO FIX:
1. Too much wasted space - content feels scattered
2. Copy is too soft and generic ("Before You Go..." feels weak)
3. Design doesn't match the gothic/premium aesthetic of the landing page
4. Social proof feels fake ("Join 2,847+ pattern archaeologists" - we don't have that data yet)
5. Icons are too basic (email icon, clock icon, etc.)

NEW DESIGN DIRECTION:

HERO SECTION (Top):
- Headline: "Your Crash Course is Coming"
- Subheadline: "Check your email in the next 60 seconds"
- Clean, centered, minimal - no email icon needed

UPSELL SECTION (Main focus):
- Remove "Special Offer" badge - looks cheap
- New headline: "Don't Stop Now"
- New subheadline: "You just got the appetizer. Here's the full method."
- Countdown: Keep it but style it better (red text, inline with copy, not in a badge)
- Pricing: Make $37 HUGE, cross out $47 smaller
- "Save $10" should be teal/pink gradient accent text
- Benefits: Use actual pattern language, not generic features:
  * "Interrupt all 7 destructive patterns"
  * "90-day circuit break protocol"
  * "Unlimited Archivist AI chat"
  * "Emergency interruption cards"
- CTA button: "Get Quick-Start - $37" (not "Yes, Add...")
- Decline link: "Skip this offer" (smaller, gray, bottom of card)

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (Bottom):
- Keep this section but make it 3 clean cards in a row
- Simpler copy:
  1. "Day 1: Pattern recognition starts"
  2. "Day 3: Find your Original Room"
  3. "Day 7: First circuit break"

REMOVE ENTIRELY:
- Social proof section (we don't have real numbers yet)
- Any fake urgency that isn't the real countdown timer

DESIGN SPECS:
- Match the landing page aesthetic: dark background, glassmorphism cards, teal/pink gradients
- Use the same bold, condensed typography
- Framer Motion animations for entrance
- Make the upsell card the visual center of gravity
- Clean, professional, premium - not "internet marketer"

The goal is to make this page feel like a natural extension of the site, not a generic upsell template.
