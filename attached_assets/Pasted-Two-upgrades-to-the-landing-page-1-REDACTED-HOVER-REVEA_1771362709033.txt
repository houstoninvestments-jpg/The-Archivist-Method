Two upgrades to the landing page:

1. REDACTED HOVER REVEAL ON CASE FILE CARDS:
Update the "From The Archives" case file cards. Instead of showing the full text immediately, redact the key breakthrough line with a black rectangle overlay (like a classified document with information blacked out).

For each card, the LAST sentence is the breakthrough. That sentence should be covered by a black bar (background: #000, height matching the text line, positioned over the text).

On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile), the black bar slides to the right and disappears (transform: translateX(100%), transition 0.6s ease), revealing the breakthrough text underneath in teal.

After reveal, it stays revealed (don't re-hide on mouse leave).

Add a small label below each card's redacted area:
[JetBrains Mono, 10px, #555]
"[ HOVER TO DECLASSIFY ]" on desktop
"[ TAP TO DECLASSIFY ]" on mobile

The revealed breakthrough lines for each card:
- Card 1: "Subject stayed in the conversation. First time in 14 years."
- Card 2: "Did not destroy 6 months of work."
- Card 3: "Reports reduced unnecessary apologies by 60% in 3 weeks."
- Card 4: "Partner responded. Relationship intact."

2. BENTO BOX DASHBOARD PREVIEW:
Add a visual preview of the actual product near the pricing section. Place it between the credibility stats bar and the pricing cards. This shows users what they're actually buying.

This Is What You Get

Create a bento grid layout (CSS grid, 2 columns desktop, 1 column mobile) showing 4 mini preview panels:

PANEL 1 (top-left, spans full width on mobile):
"Your Pattern Dashboard"
A mini mock of the portal: dark background, shows pattern name "THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN" in Playfair Display small, a body signature indicator ("Chest tightness — active"), and a streak counter "12 day streak" with a teal fire icon.
Style: rgba(255,255,255,0.03) bg, 1px border, 24px padding, JetBrains Mono for data

PANEL 2 (top-right):
"AI Pattern Coach"
A mini mock of a chat interface: 2 chat bubbles.
User bubble (dark gray): "I just ghosted her again"
Archivist bubble (teal left border): "Disappearing pattern. What did you feel in your chest right before you pulled away?"
Style: same card style, chat bubbles with appropriate styling

PANEL 3 (bottom-left):
"Body Signature Map"
A simple body outline (use CSS/SVG, just a minimal human silhouette) with 3 labeled points:
- Chest area: "Tightness" (teal dot + label)
- Stomach area: "Drop" (teal dot + label)  
- Hands: "Cold" (teal dot + label)
Small text below: "Your pattern has a physical signature. Learn to read it."

PANEL 4 (bottom-right):
"The Interrupt Protocol"
A mini mock showing a circuit break card:
"CIRCUIT BREAK — Disappearing Pattern"
"Say out loud: 'The pattern is running. I feel the tightness. I'm choosing to stay.'"
A small progress bar at bottom: "Day 11 of 90"

All 4 panels should have subtle hover effect (border brightens slightly).

The whole bento section should feel like a window into the actual product. Not screenshots — coded UI that matches the real portal aesthetic. This transforms the purchase from "I'm buying information" to "I'm buying access to a system."

Keep the bento section clean and contained. Max-width 900px. Don't let it overwhelm the page.
