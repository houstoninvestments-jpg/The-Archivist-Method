# 8.3 FINDING A THERAPIST

## A Practical Guide, Not a Referral

Finding a therapist is its own obstacle course. This section removes the friction.

## What Kind of Therapist

Not all therapists are the same. For pattern interruption work, look for therapists trained in one or more of these modalities:

**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Particularly effective for patterns rooted in specific traumatic memories. If your Archaeology Report points to a clear installation moment, EMDR can process the stored body memory.

**Somatic Experiencing (SE):** Works directly with the body's stored pattern responses. Relevant for all patterns but especially those with strong body signatures—Rage, Disappearing (freeze), and any pattern with chronic physical tension.

**Internal Family Systems (IFS):** Works with "parts"—the different internal voices and impulses that drive behavior. Maps well to the pattern framework. The pattern is essentially a "part" that was created to protect you and now operates beyond its original mandate.

**CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy):** Works with thought patterns and behavioral change. The most widely available modality and a solid complement to the protocol, especially for the Apology Loop, Compliment Deflection, and Perfectionism patterns.

**DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):** Originally developed for emotional dysregulation. Particularly relevant for the Rage Pattern and Success Sabotage. DBT teaches distress tolerance skills that pair directly with the Circuit Break.

**Attachment-Based Therapy:** Works with relational patterns rooted in early attachment experiences. Relevant for the Disappearing Pattern, Testing Pattern, Attraction to Harm, and Draining Bond.

## How to Search

**Online directories:**
- Psychology Today therapist finder (filter by specialty, insurance, modality)
- Open Path Collective (reduced-fee therapy)
- EMDR International Association directory (for EMDR-trained therapists)
- Somatic Experiencing International directory (for SE practitioners)
- IFS Institute directory (for IFS-trained therapists)

**Insurance:**
- Call your insurance provider for a list of in-network therapists
- Ask about out-of-network benefits—many plans reimburse 60-80% of out-of-network sessions
- Community mental health centers offer sliding-scale fees

**If cost is a barrier:**
- Open Path Collective: sessions for $30-$80
- Sliding-scale therapists (many private practitioners offer reduced rates)
- Training clinics at local universities (supervised graduate students at reduced cost)
- Community mental health centers
- Online therapy platforms often cost less than in-person sessions

## The Screening Call

Most therapists offer a free 15-minute consultation call. Use it. Ask these questions:

1. "What is your experience with behavioral pattern interruption or repetitive self-defeating behaviors?"
2. "What modality do you primarily use?"
3. "How do you work with clients who have identified specific behavioral circuits they want to change?"
4. "Are you comfortable with me using a self-guided system alongside our work?"
5. "What does a typical course of treatment look like for someone working on pattern change?"

**Green flags:**
- They ask about your specific goals
- They describe a structured approach (not just "we will see where it goes")
- They are open to your system and curious about it
- They mention the body or somatic experience, not just thoughts and feelings
- They name a specific modality and can explain how it applies to your situation

**Red flags:**
- "We will just talk about it" (no structure)
- Dismissal of your self-directed work ("You do not need a book, you need therapy")
- Inability to explain their approach in concrete terms
- Discomfort with you asking questions (you are interviewing them, not the reverse)
- Pressure to commit before you are ready

## What to Expect

**First session:** History taking. They will ask about your background, current challenges, and goals. Bring your Archaeology Report if you have completed it. It will save time.

**Sessions 2-4:** Assessment and relationship building. The therapist is learning your patterns in real time—by watching how you interact with them.

**Sessions 5-12:** Active work. This is where the modality kicks in. EMDR sessions look different from IFS sessions, which look different from CBT sessions. Trust the process for at least 8-12 sessions before evaluating whether it is working.

**Ongoing:** Pattern work is not a 6-session fix. Plan for 6-12 months of regular therapy alongside the protocol. Some patterns—particularly Rage, Success Sabotage, and Draining Bond—benefit from longer-term work.

## If Therapy Has Not Worked Before

Maybe you have tried therapy. Maybe it did not help. Common reasons:

**Wrong modality:** Talk therapy alone is often insufficient for body-based patterns. If you sat in a chair and discussed your feelings for months without change, try a somatic or EMDR approach instead.

**Wrong fit:** The therapeutic relationship matters as much as the modality. If you did not feel safe with your previous therapist, the work could not happen. Try a different person.

**Wrong timing:** You may not have been ready before. Readiness is not binary—it develops. If you are reading this book and doing the protocol, you are more ready now than you were then.

**No structure:** Therapy without goals or structure can become a pattern in itself—endlessly processing without changing. Bring your protocol. Bring your goals. Make the therapy as structured as the system.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Look for therapists trained in EMDR, SE, IFS, CBT, DBT, or attachment-based therapy.
• Use the screening call. Ask specific questions. You are hiring, not begging.
• Cost barriers can be addressed: sliding scale, Open Path, training clinics, insurance.
• Give it 8-12 sessions before evaluating.
• If therapy has not worked before, try a different modality, therapist, or approach. Not working once does not mean not working ever.
