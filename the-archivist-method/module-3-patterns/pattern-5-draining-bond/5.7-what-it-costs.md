# 5.7 THE DRAINING BOND: WHAT IT COSTS

The Draining Bond is the most expensive pattern in the system. Not because each activation costs a lot. Because the duration is measured in years.

---

## RELATIONSHIPS

The Draining Bond costs you every relationship except the one that is draining you. Friends fade because you have no energy for them. Family members distance because you are unavailable. Potential partners never get a chance because you are consumed.

Lia has lost: her three closest friendships (no time, no energy), two potential romantic relationships (before Ryan, she ended things with two kind people because the draining person at the time consumed her capacity), and her relationship with her sister (strained by Lia's refusal to see the problem).

The irony: the one relationship the pattern preserves is the one that is destroying all the others.

## CAREER AND MONEY

Victor: 12 years underpaid by $30,000 per year. That is $360,000. Not including raises, promotions, and equity he would have earned at a company that valued him fairly. Adjusted for career growth: closer to $500,000.

Lia: scaled back her freelance business to accommodate Ryan. Before Ryan: $65,000 per year from freelance work. After five years with Ryan: $25,000. Difference: $40,000 per year for five years. $200,000 in income.

Dana: loaned Megan $800 that will not be returned. Small number. But Dana also turned down a job that required relocation because Megan "needed her nearby." That job paid $15,000 more per year. Over 3 years: $45,000.

The pattern does not just drain your energy. It drains your earning capacity. Because you cannot pursue opportunities while maintaining a bond that demands all of your bandwidth.

---

## TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES

This is the most brutal cost. Time.

Lia: 7 years. She entered the relationship at 30. She is now 37. Those 7 years could have been spent building her career, deepening friendships, traveling, growing. Instead: managing Ryan's moods.

Victor: 12 years at a job he should have left after 3. Nine years of stagnation.

Andre: 15 years of Sunday dinners. 780 Sundays. If each Sunday consumed 5 hours: 3,900 hours. That is 162 full days. Nearly half a year of Sundays. For a mother who is demanding, not dying.

The pattern does not steal time dramatically. It steals it in increments. An evening here. A weekend there. A vacation cancelled. A project abandoned. The increments add up to years.

## HEALTH

Chronic stress from the Draining Bond produces measurable health consequences:

- **Adrenal fatigue.** Sustained cortisol output with no recovery periods.
- **Weight changes.** Gain or loss, depending on stress response.
- **Immune suppression.** More frequent illness. Longer recovery.
- **Sleep disruption.** Hypervigilance at night (is the other person okay? will there be a crisis?).
- **Chronic pain.** Back, neck, shoulders, jaw—from years of physical bracing.
- **Depression and anxiety.** Both common. The depletion produces depression. The guilt produces anxiety.

The health costs compound. Each year of the bond reduces your resilience. By year 5-7, the health decline becomes noticeable. By year 10+, it becomes a medical concern.

This is data, not shame. The bond has been
draining you. Seeing the cost clearly is the first
step toward stopping the drain.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The Draining Bond does not ask you to sacrifice
everything at once. That would be visible. It asks
for a little each day. An evening. A weekend. A
dream. By the time you add it up, years have passed
and the total is: your life.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• The Draining Bond is measured in years, not incidents.
• It costs relationships, career, time, and health—everything except the bond itself.
• Income loss from restricted career growth can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars.
• Time lost is the most irreversible cost. It does not come back.
• Health declines compound over years. Each year reduces resilience.
