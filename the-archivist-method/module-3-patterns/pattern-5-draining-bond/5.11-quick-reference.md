# 5.11 THE DRAINING BOND: QUICK REFERENCE

THE DRAINING BOND - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Chronic exhaustion, heaviness after contact, feeling older than you are
Thoughts: "They need me." "I can't leave." "No one else will help them."
Behavior: Sacrificing your needs, canceling your plans, feeling responsible for their emotions
Missing: Your own goals, friendships, energy, identity

**THE GAP:** Chronic—runs continuously. Intervene at any moment of awareness.

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"I know I should leave. I am staying out of pattern, not love or necessity. Leaving is self-preservation, not betrayal."

**Short version:** "Pattern, not loyalty."

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
Love = both people grow. Draining Bond = one person shrinks so the other can stay the same.

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: "I am not available tonight." (Hold it. Their response is data.)
Level 2: Tell one person outside the bond what is happening.
Level 3: "I have been giving more than I have. I need to stop. This is not negotiable."
Level 4: "I love you and I am leaving. Both are true."

**GUILT CHECK:**
Guilt says: "They need me." Reality: They survived before you. They will survive after.
Guilt says: "I am abandoning them." Reality: You are preserving yourself.
Guilt says: "No one else will help." Reality: You are not the only person on Earth.

**FIRST WIN:** One evening where you do not respond to a guilt-pull. One boundary held for 24 hours.

**PRACTICE:** Name the drain daily (week 1). Set one boundary (week 2). Hold it through escalation (week 3). Rebuild one outside connection (week 4).

**PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT:** This pattern often requires a therapist. That is not failure. It is strategy.

COPY TO PHONE. USE WHEN GUILT SAYS "THEY NEED
YOU" AND YOUR BODY IS ALREADY MOVING TO HELP.
