# 7.3 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: PATTERN MARKERS

You cannot interrupt what you do not see. This section teaches you to see the revision loop in real time.

## BODY SIGNATURES

When you approach a completion point—finishing a project, submitting work, making a decision—your body responds before your mind constructs the justification. Learn these signals:

**Primary signals:**
- Jaw clenching or teeth grinding
- Chest tightness or constriction
- Restless scanning (eyes darting across the work looking for errors)
- Inability to physically step away from the desk/screen
- Tension in hands and forearms (gripping)

**Secondary signals:**
- Shallow breathing or held breath
- Neck and shoulder tension (hunching over the work)
- Stomach churning when considering "submit" or "send"
- Fatigue that you override with caffeine or willpower
- Headache from sustained focus past the point of productivity

**The invisible signal:** An itch. Not physical. Mental. Something is wrong and you cannot name it. The work looks fine but feels dangerous. This itch is the pattern's activation signal. It says: "One more look. One more pass. Then you can stop." But the itch never resolves. Because it was never about the work.

## TRIGGER MAP

The pattern activates at specific points. Map yours:

**Completion triggers:** Finishing a draft, reaching the end of a project, the moment before clicking "send" or "submit."

**Evaluation triggers:** Performance reviews, deadlines, presentations, anything that will be judged by others.

**Visibility triggers:** Being put in charge, having your name on the work, public credit.

**Comparison triggers:** Seeing someone else's work. Especially if it is good. Especially if it shipped before yours.

**Delegation triggers:** Giving work to others. Reviewing their output. The gap between their standard and yours.

**Rest triggers:** The moment you try to stop working. The pattern says: "You have not earned rest yet. The work is not done." (The work is done. The pattern is not.)

Note which triggers fire hardest. Elliot's worst trigger was clicking "send" on client deliverables. Carmen's was being seen in real time—conversations, presentations, anything she could not pre-edit.

## AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS

The pattern speaks in your voice. These are its scripts:

**Quality scripts:** "It is not ready." "One more pass." "I see something that needs fixing." "Almost there."

**Protection scripts:** "If I submit this, they will see the flaws." "I cannot send this—it reflects on me." "What if there is a mistake I missed?"

**Comparison scripts:** "Theirs was better." "If I had more time, mine would be as good." "They will see the gap."

**Impossibility scripts:** "I could never do this as well as it needs to be done." "The standard is X and I am at X minus one."

**Time distortion scripts:** "Just five more minutes." (Five minutes becomes five hours.) "I will submit it tomorrow after one more review." (Tomorrow becomes next week.)

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The subject states she needs "five more minutes"
with the presentation. Observation reveals a
consistent ratio: stated time multiplied by
twelve equals actual time. "Five more minutes"
is one hour. "One more evening" is two weeks.
The subject is not lying. The pattern distorts
time perception at the point of completion.
Each revision creates a new "almost done" state
that requires its own revision. The horizon
moves at the speed of approach.

## TRACKING EXERCISE

For one week, track every revision cycle. Use this format:

| Day | Task | Times revised | Trigger | Body signal | What changed (honestly) |
|-----|------|--------------|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Mon | Client email | 4 times | Clicking send | Chest tight, held breath | Changed 2 words |
| Tue | Report draft | 3 passes | Deadline tomorrow | Jaw clenched, restless | Moved one paragraph |
| Wed | Outfit for meeting | 3 changes | Being seen | Stomach churn | Wore first outfit anyway |

After seven days, review. Look at the "What changed" column. In most cases, the revisions changed almost nothing. The work was ready at revision one or two. Everything after that was the pattern, not quality control.

The data does not lie. Your pattern does.
