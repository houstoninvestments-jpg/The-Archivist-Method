# 7.11 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: QUICK REFERENCE

THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Jaw clenching, chest tight, restless scanning, cannot step away
Thoughts: "Not ready." "One more pass." "They will see the flaws."
Behavior: Revise, redo, delay, do not submit
Disguise: "High standards." "Attention to detail." "Thoroughness."

**THE GAP:** At the revision point—when the work is done and you reach for "one more pass."

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"I am revising again. This is the pattern, not quality control. Done is better than perfect. I am submitting now."

**Short version:** "Done. Submit."

**KEY DISTINCTION:**
Quality control asks: "Is this good?" Perfectionism asks: "Is this safe from criticism?"

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: Timer rings → submit. Close the file.
Level 2: One revision pass. One. Then ship.
Level 3: Share in-progress work. Say: "Not finished. Want your thoughts."
Level 4: Ship publicly without exhaustive revision.

**THE TIMER METHOD:** Set a timer. Work. When it rings, stop. Submit. Do not reopen.

**FIRST WIN:** One email sent without rereading. One task submitted when the timer rings. One "almost done" project actually finished.

**PRACTICE:** Timer submits daily (week 1). Single-pass rule on 3 deliverables (week 2). Share one imperfect piece (week 3). Ship one thing publicly (week 4).

**REMEMBER:** The world runs on "good enough." Only the pattern insists on perfect. And the pattern has never completed anything.

COPY TO PHONE. USE WHEN YOUR HAND REACHES FOR
"ONE MORE PASS" AND YOUR JAW IS ALREADY CLENCHED.
