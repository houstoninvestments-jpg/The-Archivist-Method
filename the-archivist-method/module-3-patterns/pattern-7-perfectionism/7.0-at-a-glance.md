# 7.0 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: AT A GLANCE

## Pattern Summary

**What it is:** An automatic program that makes "good enough" feel dangerous, keeps you revising past the point of usefulness, and prevents you from finishing or shipping anything that could be judged.

**What it looks like:** Endless revision. Missed deadlines. Projects at 95% that never reach 100%. Rewriting the email for the fourteenth time. Redoing work that was already done. Inability to delegate because no one meets your standards—including you.

**What it costs:** Nothing ships. Careers stall. Relationships suffer while you "get it right." Exhaustion from a standard no human can meet. Years of productivity lost to revision cycles that change nothing meaningful.

**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪ (Moderate—the pattern disguises itself as virtue)

**The trap:** Society rewards perfectionism. Bosses praise your "attention to detail." Friends call you "dedicated." The pattern wears a costume labeled "high standards" and everyone applauds it. This makes it the hardest pattern to recognize as a pattern—because the world keeps telling you it is a strength.

## The Circuit

TRIGGER: Completion point, deadline, possibility of being evaluated
↓
BODY: Jaw tension, chest tightness, inability to step away, restless scanning for errors
↓
THOUGHT: "It is not ready." "One more pass." "They will see the flaws."
↓
BEHAVIOR: Revise again. Redo. Delay. Do not submit.
↓
COST: Nothing finishes. Everything takes three times longer. You are exhausted and have nothing to show for it.

## Circuit Break

"I am revising again. This is the pattern, not quality control. Done is better than perfect. I am submitting now."

**Short version:** "Done. Submit."

---

## Key Distinction

Quality control asks: "Is this good?" Perfectionism asks: "Is this safe from criticism?" One serves the work. The other serves the fear.
