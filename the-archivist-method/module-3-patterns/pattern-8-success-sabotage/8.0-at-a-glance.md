# 8.0 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: AT A GLANCE

## Pattern Summary

**What it is:** An automatic program that destroys what is working—relationships, careers, finances, health—precisely when things are going well. The closer you get to sustained success, the harder the pattern pushes to blow it up.

**What it looks like:** Picking fights when the relationship is good. Missing the critical deadline right before the promotion. Spending recklessly after saving for months. Cheating on the partner you love. Quitting the job that was finally working. An inexplicable urge to torch everything you have built—and acting on it.

**What it costs:** Destroyed careers. Ended relationships. Financial ruin. A resume full of promising starts and catastrophic finishes. The agonizing awareness, every time, that you did this to yourself.

**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪ (Hard—the pattern operates below conscious awareness and strikes at the worst moments)

**The trap:** You know you are doing it. You can see the sabotage unfolding in real time. You watch your hand reach for the match and you cannot stop it. Awareness alone does not interrupt this pattern. It is the one that makes people say: "I am my own worst enemy."

BEHAVIOR: Pick a fight, miss a deadline, spend money, cheat, quit, confess unnecessarily, create chaos
↓
COST: The good thing is destroyed. Relief (brief). Then devastation.

## Circuit Break

"Things are going well and I feel the urge to blow it up. This is the pattern. I do not have to act on this feeling. I can tolerate good."

**Short version:** "Tolerate good."

## Key Distinction

Self-sabotage is not stupidity. It is not weakness. It is a program that equates stability with danger—because at some point in your history, calm meant the explosion was coming. You learned to create the explosion yourself so at least you could control the timing.

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Next time things are going well and you feel
the itch to do something destructive, set a
48-hour timer. Do not act on the impulse for
48 hours. Just wait. Most sabotage impulses
lose their urgency within two days. The pattern
needs speed. Deny it.
