# 8.9 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: THE OVERRIDE

## What an Override Is

An override is a pre-scripted action that replaces the pattern's default behavior. For Success Sabotage, the default behavior is destruction. The override is deliberate inaction at the moment of maximum impulse, followed by specific stabilizing actions.

This is the hardest pattern to override because the impulse feels like the most real, most urgent thing you have ever felt. It is not. It is a program executing. You will override it not by feeling different but by acting differently despite what you feel.

## The Graduated Override Scripts

### Level 1: Name and Wait
**When to use:** First awareness of sabotage impulse—the restlessness, the itch
**What you say:** "The pattern is active. I am naming it. I am waiting 48 hours."
**What you do:** Nothing destructive. Wait. Track the impulse intensity on a 1-10 scale at 12-hour intervals. Watch it peak and decline.
**What to expect:** Peak intensity within the first 6-12 hours. Significant decline by hour 24. Most impulses below 3/10 by hour 48.

### Level 2: Name, Wait, Tell
**When to use:** Impulse is strong (above 7/10) or you are approaching your set-point threshold
**What you say:** "The pattern is active and it is strong. I am telling [name] before I act."
**What you do:** Contact your witness—the person who knows about the pattern. Tell them: "I want to [the destructive thing]. This is the pattern. I need you to know before I do anything." Then wait 48 hours.
**What to expect:** The act of telling someone often reduces the impulse by 30-50% immediately. Secrecy is the pattern's oxygen. Remove it.

### Level 3: Counter-Investment
**When to use:** You have crossed your set-point threshold and the pattern is in full activation
**What you say:** "The pattern wants me to destroy. I am investing instead."
**What you do:** Take a concrete action that deepens your investment in the thing the pattern wants to destroy. If the pattern wants you to quit: ask for the big project. If it wants you to end the relationship: plan something meaningful with your partner. If it wants you to spend: move money to a less accessible savings account.
**What to expect:** Terror. The counter-investment puts you further from the pattern's comfort zone. The discomfort will spike. This is the point. You are teaching your nervous system that deepening investment does not produce catastrophe.

### Level 4: Public Commitment
**When to use:** When you are ready to directly challenge the pattern's core mechanism
**What you say:** "I am committing publicly. The pattern cannot operate in the open."
**What you do:** Make a public commitment to the thing the pattern wants to destroy. Tell your team: "I am committed to this company long-term." Tell your partner: "I want to plan six months ahead." Tell your financial advisor: "Lock this savings. I do not want easy access." Make the commitment visible and difficult to undo.
**What to expect:** The pattern will fight. It will generate every reason why the commitment is premature, risky, or foolish. These reasons are the pattern's last defense. If the commitment is made, the sabotage becomes harder. That is the point.

## Override Practice Protocol

**Week 1: Awareness only.** Do not try to override. Just name the pattern when it activates. "That is the pattern." Track activations: when, where, what triggered it, intensity level.

**Week 2: 48-hour rule.** Apply the wait to any destructive impulse. Track: did the impulse survive 48 hours? (It almost never does.)

**Week 3: Tell someone.** Each time the impulse fires, tell your witness before acting. Track: how did telling change the intensity?

**Week 4: Counter-invest.** When the impulse fires, do the opposite of what it demands. Invest instead of withdrawing. Deepen instead of pulling away. Track the discomfort. It is high. It is temporary.

## The Stability Contract

Write this. Sign it. Give a copy to your witness:

"I, [name], recognize that I have a pattern of destroying good things when they exceed a certain threshold. I commit to the following:
- I will wait 48 hours before acting on any impulse to quit, end, spend, or destroy
- I will tell [witness name] when the pattern activates, before I act
- I will not make major decisions (quitting, ending relationships, large purchases) during pattern activation
- I understand that the discomfort of stability is temporary. The consequences of sabotage are not."

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The override for Success Sabotage is not
"stop destroying." It is "learn to tolerate
good." Destruction is the symptom. Intolerance
of stability is the cause. Every hour you
tolerate the discomfort of things going well
is an hour of recalibration. Your nervous
system is learning—not through insight, but
through experience—that good things can last.
That calm does not always precede catastrophe.
That you can hold something precious without
dropping it.

## Maintenance

This pattern reactivates during:
- Major life milestones (engagement, home purchase, significant career advancement)
- Periods of unusual calm after sustained stress
- Anniversary dates of previous sabotage events
- Times when you hear yourself say "things are going too well"

When it reactivates:
1. Name it immediately
2. Tell your witness
3. Wait 48 hours
4. Counter-invest if the impulse persists

The tools work every time. The pattern is strong, but it is predictable. And predictable means interruptible.
