# 8.10 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: TROUBLESHOOTING

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

---

### "Maybe I really am bored / unhappy / ready for a change."

Maybe. But here is the test: Is this feeling arising during a period of success or stability? Is the timing consistent with your historical pattern? Can you point to specific, evidence-based reasons for the dissatisfaction, or is it a general feeling?

If the dissatisfaction is specific ("My manager micromanages and I have documented examples"), it may be legitimate. If it is diffuse ("Something just feels off"), it is the pattern.

Apply the 48-hour rule. If the dissatisfaction is real, it will still be there in 48 hours, supported by specific evidence. If it evaporates or shifts to a different target, it was the pattern fishing for a justification.

### "I already acted. I already sabotaged."

Sabotage is not always irreversible. Assess the damage:

**Recoverable:** You picked a fight but did not say the unforgivable thing. You missed a deadline but the project is still active. You spent money but not catastrophically. You sent the angry email but can follow up with an apology.

Action: Name what happened. "That was the pattern. I acted before I caught it." Then repair. Apologize. Meet the deadline late. Return the purchase. The repair is not shameful. It is the override in action.

**Not recoverable:** You quit. You cheated. You burned the bridge completely. The money is gone.

Action: Grieve the loss. Do not use it as evidence that the pattern is right ("See? I always destroy things"). Use it as data: "This is what the pattern costs. This is why I interrupt it next time." Then rebuild. You have rebuilt before. You are still here.

### "The 48-hour rule does not work—the impulse just builds."

Two possibilities:

1. The impulse is the pattern, and 48 hours is not long enough for your cycle. Extend to 72 hours. Or one week. The longer you can tolerate the discomfort without acting, the more evidence your nervous system accumulates that the discomfort passes.

2. The impulse is being fed by real circumstances. Check: are there genuine problems in the relationship/job/situation that predate the pattern's activation? If yes, address the problems specifically—not with destruction, but with problem-solving. Have the conversation. Set the boundary. Request the change. The pattern wants scorched earth. Problem-solving wants resolution.

### "I told my partner about the pattern and now they are anxious."

This is a real risk. When you tell someone "I have a pattern of sabotaging good relationships," they may hear "I am going to sabotage this relationship." The context matters.

Frame it specifically: "I want to tell you about something I am working on, so you can help me. When things are going well for a while, I sometimes get an impulse to create conflict. It is not about you. It is an old pattern. When you see me picking fights about nothing, I need you to say: 'Is this the pattern?' That one question helps me interrupt it."

Give them a role. People manage anxiety better when they have something to do.

### "My whole life is chaos. How do I know which chaos is the pattern and which is just bad luck?"

Audit the chaos. Go back five years. List every major disruption: job changes, relationship endings, financial hits, health setbacks.

For each one, ask:
- Did this happen during a period of stability or struggle?
- Did I cause it, or did it happen to me?
- Was there an impulse I acted on?
- Was there a flicker of relief after the destruction?

External chaos (layoffs, illness, accidents) is not the pattern. Internal chaos (quitting, fighting, spending, cheating) that follows periods of stability is the pattern. The distinction is usually clear once you see it.

### "I am afraid that if I stop sabotaging, I will have to actually deal with my life."

Yes. That is exactly right.

The pattern keeps you in permanent crisis mode. Crisis mode is busy. It is urgent. It requires all your attention. It prevents you from sitting with harder questions: Am I happy? Is this the right relationship? What do I actually want?

Stability makes room for these questions. That is uncomfortable. It is also necessary. You cannot build a life you want while constantly burning down the life you have.

The questions that arise during stability are not threats. They are invitations. The pattern cannot tell the difference. You can learn to.

Right now, name one good thing in your life
that the pattern has not yet targeted. Say out
loud: "This is good. I am keeping it." Notice
the discomfort. The discomfort is the pattern
recognizing that you are onto it.
