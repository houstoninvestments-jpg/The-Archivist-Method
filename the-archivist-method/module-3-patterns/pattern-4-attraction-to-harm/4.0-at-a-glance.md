# PATTERN 4: ATTRACTION TO HARM - AT A GLANCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
ATTRACTION TO HARM - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** You are drawn to people who hurt you. Safe people feel boring. Dangerous people feel electric. You mistake chaos for chemistry.

**SHOWS UP:** Romantic relationships (primary), friendships with volatile people, jobs with toxic dynamics

**THE TRIGGER:** Meeting someone new—especially someone showing red flags. Or a safe person showing interest (feels flat, wrong, boring).

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Intense excitement, "butterflies," obsessive thinking, what you call chemistry. Also: boredom/flatness around safe people.

**THE BEHAVIOR:** Pursue the dangerous person. Ignore red flags. Leave or reject the safe person. Confuse intensity with love.

**THE COST:** Serial toxic relationships. Leaving people who would have loved you well. Years lost to people your friends warned you about.

**THE WIN:** One moment where you feel "chemistry" and pause to check: safe or familiar? One date with a safe person you give a real chance.

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 2-3 weeks (pattern is deeply body-level; requires retraining what "attraction" means)

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪ (Hard—the body signature is misleading. Danger feels identical to desire.)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
