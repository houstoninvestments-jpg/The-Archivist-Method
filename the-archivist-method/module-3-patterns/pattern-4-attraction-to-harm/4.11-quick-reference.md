# 4.11 ATTRACTION TO HARM: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
ATTRACTION TO HARM - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Around danger: Intense excitement, "butterflies," obsessive thinking, cannot eat/sleep
Around safety: Flatness, boredom, "no spark," urge to reject
Thoughts (danger): "This is chemistry." "This one is different."
Thoughts (safety): "Too nice." "Something is missing." "No spark."

**THE GAP:** Days to weeks (intervene in week 1, before bond forms)

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"I feel chemistry with this person. Let me check: are they safe or familiar? This is pattern recognition, not love. I am choosing not to pursue."

**Short version:** "Familiar, not safe."

**SAFETY ASSESSMENT:**
Safe = available, consistent, kind, no red flags, friends not worried
Familiar = hot/cold, unpredictable, intense, red flags, reminds you of someone

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: 72-hour pause. Do not pursue. Run assessment privately.
Level 2: Ask a friend: "Does this sound like my pattern?"
Level 3: "I feel nothing. That might be the pattern, not the person. Three more dates."
Level 4: "I have a pattern of chasing intensity. You are safe. I am learning what that means."

**FIRST WIN:** One moment where you feel electricity and pause to check: safe or familiar? One date with a safe person you give a real chance.

**PRACTICE:** Safety assessment for every attraction (week 1). 72-hour rule (week 2). Three-date minimum for safe people (week 3).
