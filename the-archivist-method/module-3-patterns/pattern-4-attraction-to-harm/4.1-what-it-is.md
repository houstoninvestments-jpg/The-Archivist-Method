# 4.1 ATTRACTION TO HARM: WHAT IT IS

The nice ones bore you. The dangerous ones light you on fire.

You know this about yourself. You have known it for years. Your friends know it. Your therapist knows it. Everyone who has watched you walk past the kind, stable person and straight toward the one with a trail of wreckage behind them—they all know.

You know it too. And you do it anyway.

## THE PROGRAM

Attraction to Harm is a threat-recognition system running as a desire program. Your nervous system learned, early, that love comes with danger. Not separately from it. Fused with it. The caregiver who was supposed to be safe was also the source of pain. Or chaos was the only environment where connection happened. Or intensity was the only proof that something was real.

Your body learned: this feeling—the electricity, the obsession, the cannot-eat-cannot-sleep—this is love. This is what it is supposed to feel like.

It is not love. It is recognition. Your nervous system is detecting a familiar threat pattern and coding it as attraction. The "butterflies" are your fight-or-flight response misread as desire. The "chemistry" is your amygdala recognizing a pattern from the Original Room and flooding you with the same neurochemicals that kept you bonded to an unsafe caregiver.

You are not attracted to bad people. You are attracted to familiar danger. There is a difference. One is a choice. The other is a circuit.

What you call chemistry is your nervous system
recognizing a threat it was trained to bond with.
The electricity is not attraction. It is recognition.
Your body is saying: "I know this. This is the room
I grew up in." Not: "This is the person I should
love."

## WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

From the outside, you are the person who dates disasters. Who leaves the gentle accountant for the volatile artist. Who ignores red flags that are visible from orbit. Who has a "type" that everyone else can see is a pattern of harm.

Your friends say: "Why do you always pick the wrong ones?" As if you are selecting from a menu. You are not selecting. Your body is selecting for you. And your body's criteria were set by a child who did not know the difference between love and danger because they arrived in the same package.

From the inside, the safe person feels like nothing. Flat. Grey. Like hugging a wall. No electricity. No obsession. No heat. You try. You go on three dates. You feel nothing. You conclude: no chemistry. And you walk away from someone who would have been good for you because "good" does not register in your nervous system as "real."

Then someone walks in who runs hot and cold. Who is unpredictable. Who is intense and withholding and magnetic. Your body ignites. This is chemistry. This is alive. This is love.

It is not love. It is the program running.

## THE CONFUSION

This is the hardest pattern to interrupt because the body signature is misleading.

Every other pattern has a body signature that feels bad. Chest tightness. Guilt. Panic. Flooding. You can feel the alarm and recognize: something is wrong.

Attraction to Harm has a body signature that feels good. Excitement. Electricity. Obsession. The neurochemicals flooding your system—dopamine, norepinephrine, cortisol—create a cocktail that feels like falling in love. Because it is the same cocktail. The early stages of love and the early stages of danger produce nearly identical neurochemistry.

The difference: real love settles. It calms over weeks and months into something warm, stable, deep. Familiar-danger "love" does not settle. It cycles. High and low. Intense and absent. The cycle itself produces the neurochemical hits—because each return from low to high is a fresh dopamine surge.

You are not addicted to the person. You are addicted to the cycle.

## WHO RUNS THIS PATTERN

You run Attraction to Harm if:

- Your friends have stopped being surprised by your relationship choices
- "Chemistry" is your primary criterion and it always leads to the same outcome
- Safe, available people feel boring or suffocating
- You have used the phrase "I know they are bad for me but I cannot help it"
- Your relationships follow a pattern: intense beginning, volatile middle, devastating end
- You have left or rejected someone kind because "there was no spark"
- You feel most alive in the presence of someone unpredictable

If four or more apply, this is your pattern. The excitement you feel reading this—the recognition—that is the pattern activating. Even here. Even now.
