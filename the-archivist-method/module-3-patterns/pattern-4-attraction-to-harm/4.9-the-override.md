# 4.9 ATTRACTION TO HARM: THE OVERRIDE

The Circuit Break pauses the pursuit. The Override gives you a different selection criteria.

Attraction to Harm meets the survival need for familiar connection. Your nervous system knows what danger-love feels like. It does not know what safe-love feels like. The Override: **choose based on safety assessment, not on feeling. Give safety time to register.**

---

## WHY THIS OVERRIDE WORKS

The survival need is connection. The pattern meets it by pursuing what feels familiar—which happens to be dangerous. The Override meets the same need by pursuing what is actually safe—which happens to feel unfamiliar.

The override is not "stop being attracted to intense people." You cannot override a body response. The override is: when attraction fires, check whether the person is safe before pursuing. And when safety feels boring, give it enough time to register before rejecting.

You are not changing your desires. You are adding a filter between desire and action.

OVERRIDE: GRADUATED APPROACH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**LEVEL 1 (Minimal disclosure):**
When you feel intense chemistry, pause. Do not
pursue for 72 hours. Run the safety assessment
privately. No one needs to know.

**LEVEL 2 (Partial disclosure):**
Tell a trusted friend about the new person. Ask:
"Does this sound like my pattern?" Let them answer
honestly. Follow their assessment for one week.

**LEVEL 3 (Pattern disclosure without vulnerability):**
If dating someone safe and feeling flat, say to
yourself or a friend: "I feel nothing. That might
be the pattern, not the person. I am giving this
three more dates."

**LEVEL 4 (Full vulnerability):**
To the safe person, if the relationship develops:
"I want to be honest. I have a pattern of being
drawn to intensity and dismissing safety. I am
working on it. You might need to be patient with
me while my nervous system catches up to what my
brain already knows—that you are good for me."

**Start with Level 1-2. Level 4 requires a
relationship that has proven safe over weeks.**

## SCENARIOS: OLD PATTERN VS. OVERRIDE

### SCENARIO A: Two options—one dangerous, one safe

**Old Pattern:**
Meet Person A (safe) and Person B (dangerous) the same week. Feel electricity with B. Feel nothing with A. Pursue B. Reject A. Six months later: B is gone. A is gone. Pattern confirmed.

**Override (Level 2):**
Feel electricity with B. Circuit Break: "Familiar, not safe." Tell friend about both. Friend says: "B sounds like Marcus." Agree to three dates with A and 72-hour pause on B. By date 3 with A: small warmth beginning. B's texts have already become inconsistent. Data collected.

### SCENARIO B: Early stages with a dangerous person

**Old Pattern:**
Two weeks in. Obsessed. Cannot focus on work. Checking phone constantly. Rationalizing the red flags. "They are just guarded."

**Override (Level 1):**
Two weeks in. Feel the obsession. Circuit Break. Run safety assessment on paper:
- Available? Sometimes.
- Consistent? No.
- Red flags? Yes—hot and cold, vague about past, cancelled twice.
- Do they remind me of someone? Yes.

Assessment: familiar, not safe. Decision: do not pursue further. Delete number if necessary. The neurochemistry will protest for 1-2 weeks. It fades.

### SCENARIO C: Dismissing a safe person on date one

**Old Pattern:**
First date with a kind, available person. Nice conversation. No electricity. Drive home thinking: "No spark." Do not schedule date two.

**Override (Level 3):**
First date. No electricity. Notice the pattern's verdict: "boring." Circuit Break: "Safe, not boring. The pattern is dismissing this person. I am giving three dates." Schedule date two. On date two: slight warmth. Laughter. A moment of genuine connection. Not electricity—connection. Schedule date three.

### SCENARIO D: Currently in a volatile relationship

**Old Pattern:**
Six months in. The cycle is running: intensity, withdrawal, return. You know this is the pattern. You cannot leave. The bond is too strong.

**Override (Level 2):**
Name it: "I am in a pattern relationship. The chemistry is the bond, not love." Tell a friend. Ask for accountability. Begin the process of disentangling. This may require therapy, especially if the relationship has escalated to abuse. See Pattern 5 (Draining Bond) if you cannot leave.

## EXECUTION STEPS

**Step 1:** When chemistry fires, run the safety assessment. On paper. Safe or familiar?

**Step 2:** If familiar: 72-hour pause. No pursuit. No texting beyond basic politeness.

**Step 3:** If currently dismissing a safe person: three-date minimum. Give safety time.

**Step 4:** Check with a trusted friend. "Does this person sound like my pattern?" Trust their external view more than your internal assessment during the first 2-3 weeks.

**Step 5:** Track the pattern. Log each attraction. Note: safe or familiar? Pursued or paused? Outcome? Over time, the data builds a case your body cannot ignore.

## TIMELINE TO NATURAL

**Weeks 1-4:** The Circuit Break feels like fighting your own body. The chemistry screams pursue. The break says pause. It is exhausting. You will feel deprived. The pattern says: you are missing out.

**Months 1-2:** The first safe person you give a real chance begins to register differently. Not as electricity. As something quieter. The nervous system is confused—this is new input. It does not match the template. It does not dismiss it either.

**Months 2-3:** If you stay with a safe person, the bond begins to form. Slowly. Without the cycle. Without the crash. It does not feel like "falling." It feels like "arriving."

**Months 3-6:** The template begins to update. Safe starts to register as attractive, not boring. You may still feel the pull toward a dangerous person—the electricity does not fully disappear. But you recognize it now. It is not love. It is recognition. You can feel it without obeying it.

**Months 6+:** Choosing safety becomes a skill. Not automatic—the old template is deeply wired. But available. Reliable. You can feel the electricity and choose not to follow it. That is freedom.

## REPS NEEDED

This pattern requires fewer reps but longer duration per rep. You do not need 50 swaps. You need 2-3 experiences of choosing safety over danger and staying with the choice long enough for the nervous system to recalibrate (3-6 months each).

2-3 sustained experiences of safe connection. That is the prescription. Not easy. Not fast. But specific.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
You do not have to stop feeling the electricity.
You have to stop following it. Feel the pull.
Acknowledge it. Then walk the other direction.
Toward the person who does not make your heart
race. Yet. Give it time. Safety is a slow burn.
It is also the only thing that lasts.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Override: choose based on safety assessment, not feeling. Give safety time.
• 72-hour rule for intense chemistry. 3-date minimum for safe people.
• Trust friends' assessments over your own in the first 2-3 weeks.
• The nervous system recalibrates in 3-6 months with a safe partner.
• 2-3 sustained safe experiences update the template.
• You can feel the electricity and choose not to follow it. That is the goal.
