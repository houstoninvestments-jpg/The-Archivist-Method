# 3.7 THE TESTING PATTERN: WHAT IT COSTS

The Testing Pattern has a specific cost: it destroys the thing it is trying to protect. Every test designed to confirm someone cares brings that person one step closer to not caring anymore.

## RELATIONSHIPS

The primary cost. The Testing Pattern is a relationship-ending machine.

Anika has had 6 relationships in 4 years. Average duration: 4-8 months. Each one ended the same way: the partner could not sustain the tests.

Here is the math. One test per week. Each test creates a small amount of emotional damage. Not catastrophic—small. A confused text exchange. A fight about nothing. A feeling of walking on eggshells.

52 tests per year. 52 small damages. The average person can absorb approximately 20-30 before they start to disengage. By month 4-8, the partner hits their limit. They do not leave because they stopped loving. They leave because the testing made the relationship feel like work instead of connection.

Cost per relationship: 4-8 months of investment, the emotional fallout of another ending, and the confirmation that the pattern was right—they left.

Cost over 4 years: 6 people who cared. 6 departures. 6 confirmations that people leave. The pattern is stronger now than it was 4 years ago.

## CAREER AND MONEY

The Testing Pattern at work manifests as constant reassurance-seeking disguised as professionalism.

Marcus sends his boss 2-3 "check-in" emails per week. Each one is a test. Each one costs his boss time and patience. Managers interpret constant reassurance-seeking as lack of confidence. Lack of confidence blocks promotions.

Marcus has been passed over twice. Not for performance—his work is excellent. For perceived readiness. His boss told HR: "He is talented but I am not sure he can operate independently."

Translation: the tests made him look dependent. The pattern designed to ensure job security is the thing threatening job security.

Estimated career cost: 2-3 years of delayed advancement. $30,000-$60,000 in salary growth.

## TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES

The Testing Pattern consumes hours. Not just the test itself—the entire cycle.

Pre-test: 1-3 hours of scanning, monitoring, anxiety, and test design.
Test execution: 15-60 minutes.
Waiting for result: 30 minutes to several hours.
Post-test processing: 1-2 hours of relief, guilt, or conflict resolution.

Total per cycle: 3-7 hours.

At one cycle per week: 156-364 hours per year. That is 4-9 full work weeks spent on testing.

Those hours could have been spent on the relationship itself. On work. On friends. On anything that builds rather than monitors.

## HEALTH

The Testing Pattern is cardiovascularly expensive. Repeated fight-or-flight activation—heart racing, cortisol flooding, hypervigilance—multiple times per week for years.

Physical costs:
- Chronic elevated heart rate and blood pressure
- Sleep disruption (the scanning continues at night—checking phone, lying awake)
- Appetite changes (cannot eat during high-anxiety phases)
- Adrenal fatigue from repeated cortisol surges
- Tension headaches from constant hypervigilance
- Digestive issues from chronic anxiety

The psychological cost is equally significant: you cannot relax. Not fully. Not for long. Because relaxation is a trigger. Calm means something is about to go wrong. Your nervous system is on duty 24/7. It never clocks out.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• The Testing Pattern destroys relationships through accumulated small damages—52 tests per year.
• Partners leave from exhaustion, not indifference. The pattern cannot see the difference.
