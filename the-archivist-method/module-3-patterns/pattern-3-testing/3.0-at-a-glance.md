# PATTERN 3: THE TESTING PATTERN - AT A GLANCE

THE TESTING PATTERN - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** You create tests for people to prove they care. If they pass, you feel relief for 48 hours. Then you test again.

**SHOWS UP:** Romantic relationships (primary), close friendships, family, any relationship where attachment matters

**THE TRIGGER:** Things going well, partner seeming distant (even normally), stability, calm, contentment

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Panic, heart racing, hypervigilance, scanning for signs of imminent abandonment

**THE BEHAVIOR:** Pick fights, create loyalty tests, push away to see if they chase, make provocative statements, threaten to leave

**THE COST:** Exhausted partners who leave—not because they do not love you, but because they cannot pass one more test. Self-fulfilling abandonment prophecy.

**THE WIN:** One moment of anxiety where you ask directly for reassurance instead of creating a test.

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 7-14 days of Circuit Break practice

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪ (Moderate—clear activation, but the urge to test feels urgent and rational)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
