# 3.10 THE TESTING PATTERN: TROUBLESHOOTING

## WHEN INTERRUPTION IS NOT WORKING

You are still testing. The direct ask feels impossible. The anxiety is winning. Here is what to expect and what to adjust.

---

### WEEK 1-2: TESTS STILL RUNNING AT 100%

**What is happening:** You are recognizing the tests after they happen. "I just tested them." But the recognition comes too late—the provocative text was already sent, the fight already started.

**This is normal.** After-the-fact recognition is stage one. The pattern has been running for years. You are now seeing it. That visibility is the first win.

**What to do:** After each test, write down what you actually needed. Not what the test was—what the need underneath was. "I needed to know he was not leaving." "I needed to feel wanted." Each log entry trains you to see the need before the test disguises it.

### WEEK 3-4: CATCHING THE TEST BUT CANNOT STOP IT

**What is happening:** You see the test forming. You recognize the surveillance. You know the provocative text is the pattern. But the anxiety is so strong that the test still fires. You know it is a test and you send it anyway.

**This is progress.** Seeing the test in real time—even when you cannot stop it—is a significant upgrade. You are conscious during execution. The gap between "I know this is a test" and "I am not going to do it" is bridgeable. Not today. Soon.

**What to do:** Add a 10-minute delay. When the test is ready to deploy, set a timer. Ten minutes. During those ten minutes: box breathing, walk, physical movement. After ten minutes, reassess. If the urge is still at 10/10: you can send it. If it is at 7/10 or below: try the direct ask instead.

### WEEK 5+: THREE POSSIBLE ISSUES

**Issue 1: The anxiety is too chronic to interrupt in the moment.**

The Testing Pattern runs on a baseline of anxiety that does not fully resolve between activations. If your baseline anxiety is always at 6/10, every minor trigger pushes you to 9/10 instantly. There is no ramp-up to catch.

**Fix:** Address the baseline. Daily box breathing: 5 minutes, twice a day, regardless of activation status. Physical exercise: 30 minutes of elevated heart rate. These lower the baseline so that triggers do not immediately spike to unmanageable levels.

If baseline anxiety is persistent and severe, consider therapy specifically for anxiety management alongside this work.

**Issue 2: Your partner is actually pulling away.**

Not every activation is the pattern. Sometimes the person is actually distancing. If the pattern has been running for months and the partner is now walking on eggshells, their withdrawal may be real—caused by the testing, but real.

**Fix:** Have a direct conversation (not a test). "I think my anxiety has been hard on you. I want to know honestly where you are at." This requires Level 4 vulnerability. It also requires being prepared for an honest answer that might be hard to hear. But real information is always better than test results.

**Issue 3: The relief from direct asking does not last.**

You asked directly. They reassured you. The relief lasted 24 hours. Then the anxiety was back. This feels like the ask does not work.

**Fix:** The ask does work—it produced reassurance without damage. The 24-48 hour relief window is a feature of anxious attachment, not a failure of the ask. Over time, as you accumulate successful asks, the relief duration extends. 24 hours becomes 48. 48 becomes a week. This is gradual. The pattern took years to build. It does not uninstall in weeks.

## FAILED INTERRUPT CASE STUDY

**Subject: Layla, 25. Running the Testing Pattern for 11 years.**

Layla's friend Jen posts a photo with someone else captioned "best day ever." Layla's stomach drops. The monitoring begins. She checks Jen's followers. Checks who liked the photo. Composes a text: "Are we okay? I feel like you have been distant."

She recognizes the test. Says the Circuit Break under her breath: "Not a test. Ask directly."

She deletes the text. Composes a new one: "Hey, I am having an anxious day. Can we talk this week?"

Then the pattern argues: "That sounds needy. She will think you are weird. Just send the original."

Layla sends a third version—a compromise: "Hey! Miss you. Want to grab coffee Thursday?"

It is not the direct ask she practiced. It is not the test she would have sent. It is somewhere in between.

**What Layla learned:** The full Override was too much for this activation. But the text she sent was 70% Override and 30% pattern. That is not failure. That is a partial interrupt. The test she would have sent ("Are we okay?") was replaced with something warmer and lower-pressure.

**Adjustment made:** Layla accepted that the graduated approach means some interrupts will be partial. A 70% Override is better than a 100% test. Next time she will aim for 80%.

Jen responds: "Yes! Thursday is perfect. I miss you too." No drama. No eggshells. No test aftermath to clean up.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Weeks 1-2: tests still run. Recognition after the fact is the first stage.
• Weeks 3-4: catching the test mid-formation. Add a 10-minute delay.
• Week 5+: check baseline anxiety, real vs. pattern withdrawal, and relief duration.
• Partial interrupts (70% Override, 30% test) count as progress.
• Relief duration extends over time with accumulated successful asks.
