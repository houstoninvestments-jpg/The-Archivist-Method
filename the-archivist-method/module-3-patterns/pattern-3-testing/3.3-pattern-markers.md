## BODY SIGNATURES

The Testing Pattern activates with high arousal. Your nervous system is not shutting down—it is ramping up. Scanning. Searching. Alert.

1. **Heart racing.** Fast. Hard. You can feel your pulse in your throat, your temples. This is the primary marker. The heart is preparing for bad news.

2. **Hypervigilance.** Everything is a signal. Their tone. Their word choice. How long they took to respond. What they posted. Who liked their photo. Your attention narrows onto the relationship and filters everything through the question: are they leaving?

3. **Chest panic.** Not the tightness of the Disappearing Pattern. A flutter. A bird trapped in a cage. Something alive and frantic in the center of your chest.

4. **Stomach dropping.** The elevator feeling. When the text does not come. When their tone shifts. When they look at their phone instead of you.

5. **Restlessness.** Cannot sit still. Cannot focus. Cannot think about anything except the relationship status. Legs bouncing. Hands checking phone.

6. **Breathing changes.** Shallow and fast. Upper chest only. The body is in threat-detection mode. It is not breathing for calm. It is breathing for combat.

7. **Hot face.** Flushing. Especially when composing the test. The body knows what you are about to do. The face heats before the text is sent.

## AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS

The Testing Pattern generates thoughts that sound like intuition. They feel like accurate assessments. They are scripts.

1. "They are going to leave."
2. "Something is wrong. I can feel it."
3. "If they really cared, they would know I need them right now."
4. "They are pulling away. I can tell."
5. "I need to find out now before it gets worse."
6. "This is too good. Something bad is coming."
7. "Let me see if they will fight for me."

The key marker: the thoughts frame the test as detection, not creation. "I need to find out" implies the leaving is already happening and you are just discovering it. In reality, you are not finding out. You are forcing the question.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The automatic thought says "I need to find out if
they care." You do not need to find out. You need to
create a situation that forces them to prove it. That
is not detection. That is engineering. The test is not
a question. It is a provocation.

## BEHAVIORAL URGES

1. **Check their phone/social media.** Not casually. Forensically. Who liked what. Who commented. When they were last active. Evidence collection.

2. **Compose a provocative message.** Something designed to force a response. "I think we need to talk." "I do not know if this is working." "I saw you were online but you did not text me."

3. **Pull away to see if they chase.** Stop texting. Cancel plans. Go cold. Wait. See what they do. If they come after you: passed. If they do not: failed. (Or: they respected what looked like a boundary. But the pattern reads it as failure.)

4. **Pick a fight about nothing.** A minor issue inflated into a major conflict. The fight is not about the dishes. The fight is about: will you stay even when I make it hard?

5. **Threaten the relationship.** "Maybe we should take a break." "Maybe this is not working." Said not because you mean it but because you need them to say: "No. I want this. I am staying."

## PRACTICE PROTOCOL: NEXT 24 HOURS

**Step 1:** Write down your three most recent tests. Be honest. What did you do? What were you actually testing for?

Test 1: ________________. Testing for: ________________.
Test 2: ________________. Testing for: ________________.
Test 3: ________________. Testing for: ________________.

**Step 2:** For each test, write what you actually needed. Not the test. The need underneath.

Test 1 need: ________________.
Test 2 need: ________________.
Test 3 need: ________________.

In most cases, the need is simple: "I needed to know they are not leaving." "I needed reassurance." "I needed to feel wanted."

**Step 3:** If the urge to test arises in the next 24 hours—heart racing, scanning, composing a provocative text—do one thing:

Ask directly for what you need.

Not "We need to talk." But: "I am feeling anxious. Can you tell me we are okay?"

Direct ask instead of indirect test. One time. That is your first practice.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Heart racing and hypervigilance are the primary body markers. The body goes into surveillance mode.
• Automatic thoughts frame tests as "detection" when they are actually "creation."
• Behavioral urges include phone checking, provocative messages, going cold, and manufactured fights.
• The need underneath every test is simple: "Are you staying?"
• Practice: next time the urge hits, ask directly instead of testing. One time.
