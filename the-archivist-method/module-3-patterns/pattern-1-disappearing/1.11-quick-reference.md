# 1.11 THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Chest tightness, claustrophobia, urge to flee, shallow breathing, jaw tension
Thoughts: "I need space." "Too much." "I should not have let them this close."
Urges: Reach for phone, manufacture exit, go silent, cancel plans

**THE GAP:** 3-7 seconds (your interruption window)

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"The Disappearing Pattern just activated. I feel chest tightness. The pattern wants me to pull away. I am choosing to stay and communicate instead."

**Short version:** "Pattern. Stay."

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: "I need a minute." (Stay in the room. Do not explain.)
Level 2: "I am feeling overwhelmed. It is not about you. I am not going anywhere."
Level 3: "I have a pattern where I pull away when things get close. It is activating right now. It is the pattern, not you."
Level 4: "My instinct is to run right now. That scares me. I am staying because I do not want to lose this."

**FIRST WIN:** One time where your chest tightens and you stay in the room. You say one true thing instead of disappearing.

**PRACTICE:** Say Circuit Break 10x daily for one week. Deploy during live activation in week 3.
