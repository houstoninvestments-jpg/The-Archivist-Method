# 1.10 THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN: TROUBLESHOOTING

## WHEN INTERRUPTION IS NOT WORKING

The pattern is still running. You have been trying. Here is what to expect and what to adjust.

---

### WEEK 1-2: PATTERN STILL RUNS 100%

**What is happening:** You are recognizing the pattern after it runs. Sometimes during. But the behavior still executes. You still cancel plans. You still go quiet. You still leave.

**This is normal.** You are in the recognition-building phase. The pattern has decades of reinforcement. Your Circuit Break has days. The pattern wins. For now.

**What to do:** Keep logging. Every activation: trigger, body signature, thought, behavior, cost. The log is training your recognition speed. Each entry moves your awareness 1-2 seconds earlier in the circuit.

**Do not:** Judge yourself. Change the approach. Try harder. "Try harder" is willpower. Willpower does not work here. Repetition works here.

### WEEK 3-4: RECOGNITION FASTER, PATTERN STILL RUNS

**What is happening:** You are catching the chest tightness in real time. You feel the urge to leave and you know it is the pattern. But the behavior still runs. You say the Circuit Break and reach for your phone anyway. You name the pattern and cancel the plans regardless.

**This is progress.** Not victory. Progress. You are in the circuit. You are conscious during execution. That was not true two weeks ago.

**What to do:** Focus on delay, not prevention. Can you stay 10 minutes longer than last time? Can you wait 24 hours before canceling? Can you respond to the text before going silent? Delay is the precursor to interruption. Each delay stretches the Gap.

### WEEK 5+: THREE POSSIBLE ISSUES

If the pattern is still running at full strength after 5 weeks of daily practice, one of three things is happening.

**Issue 1: You are not saying it out loud.**

You are doing the Circuit Break in your head. That is significantly less effective. The pattern lives in your internal monologue. Speaking creates an external channel that disrupts the circuit.

**Fix:** Say it out loud. Whisper counts. Mutter counts. Silent does not count.

**Issue 2: The trigger is too intense for your current level.**

Some triggers are harder than others. "I love you" from a partner of six months is a harder trigger than a friend suggesting lunch next week. If you are only encountering high-intensity triggers, the pattern has maximum momentum.

**Fix:** Practice the Override with low-intensity triggers first. A coworker wanting to collaborate. A friend suggesting plans. Get wins at low intensity before facing high intensity.

**Issue 3: There is an unaddressed secondary pattern.**

The Disappearing Pattern often overlaps with Success Sabotage or the Testing Pattern. If a secondary pattern is running simultaneously, it can override your Circuit Break.

**Fix:** Identify the secondary pattern. Read its chapter. Determine which pattern activates first in the sequence. Interrupt the first one.

## FAILED INTERRUPT CASE STUDY

**Subject: Elena, 29. Running the Disappearing Pattern for 11 years.**

Elena has been practicing the Circuit Break for three weeks. Her partner, Jordan, asks if they can spend the holidays with Elena's family.

Elena's chest locks. She recognizes it instantly. She says the Circuit Break under her breath in the kitchen: "The Disappearing Pattern just activated. I feel chest tightness. The pattern wants me to pull away. I am choosing to stay and communicate."

Then Jordan walks in and asks again. Elena hears herself say: "I do not think that is a good idea. My family is a lot."

The pattern ran. Despite the Circuit Break. Despite the recognition.

**What Elena learned:** The Circuit Break delayed the behavior by approximately 45 seconds. Before practice, the deflection would have been instant. Now there was a gap. 45 seconds. The behavior still executed, but slower.

**Adjustment made:** Elena texted Jordan later that evening: "I want to think more about the holiday thing. My first reaction was no, but I think that was automatic. Can we talk about it tomorrow?"

**Second attempt succeeded.** The next day, calmer, Elena said: "My pattern is to avoid anything that makes relationships more real. Meeting my family feels like a big step and that scared me. I want to do it. I just needed to get past the knee-jerk."

Jordan met the family at Thanksgiving. Elena's chest was tight for the first hour. Then it loosened. New data collected.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Weeks 1-2: pattern runs at 100%. Normal. Keep logging.
• Weeks 3-4: recognition faster, pattern still executes. This is progress.
• Week 5+: check three issues—out loud, trigger intensity, secondary patterns.
• Failed interrupts still generate data. A 45-second delay is a win.
• The "second attempt" strategy: text or revisit the conversation later, calmer.
