# PATTERN 2: THE APOLOGY LOOP - AT A GLANCE

THE APOLOGY LOOP - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** You apologize for existing. For needing. For wanting. For taking up any space at all.

**SHOWS UP:** Everywhere—romantic, work, friendship, family, strangers, cashiers, people who bump into you

**THE TRIGGER:** Needing to ask for anything—help, attention, time, boundaries, a raise, a favor

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Guilt (preemptive), throat tightening, physical shrinking, making yourself smaller

**THE BEHAVIOR:** "Sorry" before every sentence, minimize needs, defer to others, accept less than you need

**THE COST:** Chronic underpayment, zero boundaries, burnout, resentment you never express, people who take advantage

**THE WIN:** One request made without apologizing. "I need tomorrow off." Not "Sorry, I know it is bad timing, but..."

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 3-7 days (clear marker, simple interrupt)

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚪⚪⚪ (Easy—"sorry" is obvious and frequent, giving many practice opportunities)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
