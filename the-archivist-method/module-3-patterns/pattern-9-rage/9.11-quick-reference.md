# 9.11 THE RAGE PATTERN: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE RAGE PATTERN - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Heat rising (chest → neck → face), jaw/fists clenching, tunnel vision, heart racing
Thoughts: "They cannot do this to me." "I will not be treated like this."
Behavior: Explode—yelling, cruel words, intimidation, breaking things
Speed: 2-10 seconds from trigger to explosion. Fastest circuit in the archive.

**THE GAP:** At the first heat—before full activation. Seconds only.

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"The rage is here. It is not me. I am leaving this room for 20 minutes. I will return when I can speak, not explode."

**Short version:** "I need 20 minutes." Then leave.

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: Feel the heat → "I need 20 minutes" → Leave the room. No exceptions.
Level 2: Return after 20+ min → "I left because I was going to say something I would regret. Can we talk calmly?"
Level 3: Pre-announce → "I may need to step out. It is not about you. It is my anger strategy."
Level 4: Get professional help. This pattern benefits from a therapist. That is strategy, not failure.

**COOL-DOWN TOOLS:**
- Cold water on wrists (lowers heart rate in 30 seconds)
- Breathe: 4 counts in, 6 counts out
- Walk (do not run)
- Grip and release fists (3 rounds of 10 seconds)
- Name sensations: "Heart rate up. Jaw clenched. These are not commands."

**FIRST WIN:** One exit. One time you felt the heat and left instead of exploding. That is the foundation.

**PRACTICE:** Exit at every heat signal (week 1). Refine cool-down (week 2). Return and repair (week 3). Pre-announce to family (week 4).

**REMEMBER:** Leave the room. Twenty minutes. Cold water. Breathe. Return when you can speak, not explode.
