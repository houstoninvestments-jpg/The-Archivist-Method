# 6.11 COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Heat in face/chest, squirming, eye-contact break, nervous laughter
Thoughts: "That is not true." "They are just being nice." "It was nothing."
Behavior: Minimize, externalize, joke, redirect, correct
Speed: Under 2 seconds. Reflex, not decision.

**THE GAP:** Immediate—the deflection fires within seconds of the compliment.

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"Someone just complimented me. I want to deflect. I am saying only: Thank you. No deflection. No minimization."

**Short version:** "Thank you. Full stop."

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: "Thank you." (Close mouth. Let silence exist.)
Level 2: "Thank you. I appreciate that."
Level 3: "Thank you. I worked hard on that."
Level 4: "I want to share something I am proud of."

**SELF-COMPLIMENT:** Once daily. State what you did. "I completed that." "I handled that." Facts first. Evaluation later.

**FIRST WIN:** One compliment received with only "Thank you." No follow-up. No joke. No minimization. Feel the squirm. Let it pass.

**PRACTICE:** Track all deflections (week 1). "Thank you" to every compliment (week 2). Add acknowledgment (week 3). Validate accomplishments (week 4).

**IF DEFLECTION FIRES FIRST:** Go back. "Earlier when you said [X], I deflected. I want to try again. Thank you."

**REMEMBER:** Modesty says "Thank you, I worked hard." The pattern says "It was nothing." One is grace. The other is self-erasure.
