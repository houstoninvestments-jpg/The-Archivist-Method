# 6.1 PATTERNS AT WORK

## Where the Program Runs 40+ Hours Per Week

Your pattern does not clock out when you clock in. It follows you through the office door, sits in your meetings, answers your emails, and negotiates your salary. Every professional decision you make is filtered through the same program that runs your personal life.

The difference: at work, the consequences are measured in money, opportunity, and career trajectory. And work provides something your personal life does not—consistent, repeated triggers five days a week, every week, for decades.

## How Each Pattern Shows Up at Work

### The Disappearing Pattern
**At work looks like:** Going quiet in meetings. Not following up. Withdrawing from team collaboration when deadlines approach. Taking on solo projects to avoid interdependence. Missing networking opportunities because proximity to colleagues feels unsafe.

**Career cost:** You are invisible. Not because you lack talent but because you remove yourself from situations where talent is noticed. Promotions go to people who are present. You are technically present but operationally absent.

**Work interrupt:** Before your next meeting, set one intention: contribute one thought. One sentence. Not a presentation. One sentence. Build from there.

### The Apology Loop
**At work looks like:** Starting emails with "Sorry to bother you." Prefacing ideas with "This might be stupid but." Apologizing for asking questions. Declining credit for your work. Over-thanking people for doing their jobs.

**Career cost:** You have trained your colleagues to value your contributions at the rate you value them—which is low. Your manager does not hear your ideas. They hear your apologies. And apologies do not get promoted.

**Work interrupt:** Audit your next five work emails. Count the unnecessary apologies. Replace each "sorry" with a neutral statement. "Sorry to bother you" becomes "Quick question." "Sorry for the delay" becomes "Thanks for your patience."

### The Testing Pattern
**At work looks like:** Setting up situations to see if your manager values you. Withholding effort to see if anyone notices. Declining to ask for what you need and then resenting when it is not offered. Interpreting neutral feedback as rejection.

**Career cost:** You are managing a loyalty test instead of managing your career. Your energy goes to monitoring others' commitment to you rather than to your own work quality.

**Work interrupt:** When you want to test—ask directly instead. "Am I on track for the promotion we discussed?" replaces the elaborate test designed to reveal the same information.

### Attraction to Harm
**At work looks like:** Drawn to chaotic work environments. Thriving in crisis mode but deteriorating in stability. Choosing managers who are unpredictable. Staying in toxic workplaces because the dysfunction feels familiar.

**Career cost:** You build expertise in surviving chaos rather than building something sustainable. Your resume is a series of intense, short stints.

**Work interrupt:** Before accepting any new role, run the safety-versus-familiarity check. Does this workplace excite you because it is a genuine opportunity—or because the chaos feels like home?

### The Draining Bond
**At work looks like:** Taking on everyone's tasks. Being the emotional support person for the entire team. Inability to say no to requests. Working overtime to compensate for others' underperformance. Being the one who "holds everything together."

**Career cost:** You are indispensable and unpromotable. They cannot promote you because no one else does what you do. And what you do is everyone else's job.

**Work interrupt:** Track one week of requests. Categorize each as "my responsibility" or "not my responsibility." For every "not my responsibility," respond with: "I cannot take that on right now. Have you tried [actual responsible person]?"

### Compliment Deflection
**At work looks like:** Deflecting praise from managers. Attributing success to the team, luck, or timing. Refusing to advocate for yourself in performance reviews. Underselling your accomplishments. Not applying for roles you qualify for because "I am not that good."

**Career cost:** You are underpaid and under-titled. Not because the market undervalues your skills—because you do. Every deflected compliment at work is a missed brick in the case for your next raise.

**Work interrupt:** In your next performance review, state three accomplishments without deflection. "I delivered X. I improved Y by Z%. I led the initiative that resulted in [outcome]." Facts. No minimizing.

### Perfectionism
**At work looks like:** Missing deadlines because the work is not perfect. Redoing completed tasks. Inability to delegate. Spending 80% of your time on the last 20% of quality that no one requested. Never shipping.

**Career cost:** Your output volume is half your peers'. Your quality is higher, but the market does not reward quality linearly—it rewards shipped work.

**Work interrupt:** The timer method. Set a deadline. When the timer sounds, submit. Practice with low-stakes deliverables first. One email sent without rereading. One report submitted after one revision pass.

### Success Sabotage
**At work looks like:** Quitting before the promotion. Picking a fight with your manager during your best quarter. Self-destructing right before a milestone. Missing a critical deadline you could have met. Creating conflict where there was stability.

**Career cost:** A career of almosts. Almost got the promotion. Almost stayed long enough. Almost built something lasting.

**Work interrupt:** Know your set point. If you tend to sabotage at the 6-month mark, prepare at month 5. Tell your witness. Use the 48-hour rule on any impulse to quit, send an angry email, or make a dramatic change.

### The Rage
**At work looks like:** Explosive reactions to feedback. Intimidating colleagues. Sending angry emails you regret. Slamming doors, raising your voice, or creating an atmosphere of fear. Being "passionate" in ways that make people avoid you.

**Career cost:** People manage you instead of working with you. Your ideas go unchallenged—not because they are perfect but because the cost of challenging you is too high.

**Work interrupt:** The 20-minute exit applies at work too. "I need to step away for a moment" is always available. Draft angry emails. Do not send them. Return in 20 minutes. Read the draft. Delete it. Write a new one.

## The Salary Conversation

Every pattern undermines salary negotiation in its own way:

- Disappearing: You do not negotiate at all. You accept the first offer.
- Apology Loop: "I am sorry, I know this is a lot to ask, but could I possibly..."
- Testing: You do not ask and resent when they do not offer.
- Draining Bond: You feel guilty asking for more when they already "do so much."
- Compliment Deflection: "I do not think I am really worth that much."
- Perfectionism: You wait until your work is "perfect enough" to justify asking. It never is.
- Success Sabotage: You sabotage before the review happens.
- Rage: You demand instead of negotiate. Or you explode when the offer is low.

Name which script runs during your salary conversations. Then use your Circuit Break before the next one.
