# 0.1 YOU JUST RAN YOUR PATTERN

You did it again.

You know exactly what you did. You felt it happening. You watched yourself do it. And you did it anyway.

That is why you are here.

## STOP. READ THIS FIRST.

You are not broken. You are not weak. You are not a lost cause.

You are running a pattern. A program. A circuit that installed itself a long time ago, in a room you may or may not remember. That program just executed. Again.

Here is what you need to know right now, in the next sixty seconds:

**The pattern is not you.** It runs through you. It uses your hands, your mouth, your legs. But it is not you. You are the one watching it happen and feeling sick about it afterward.

**You noticed.** That matters more than you think. Most people run their patterns for decades without ever seeing them. You saw yours. You are here. That is the first data point.

**One interrupt changes everything.** You do not need to fix this today. You do not need to understand it today. You need one successful interrupt. One time where the pattern activates and you do something different. One time. That is proof the circuit can be broken.

## WHAT JUST HAPPENED (THE SHORT VERSION)

Something triggered you. Could have been a word. A tone. A silence. A look on someone's face. Something that matched a file in your archive.

Your body responded before your brain caught up. Chest tightened. Stomach dropped. Heat rose. Throat closed. Something physical happened in under three seconds.

Then a thought fired. Automatic. Fast. Familiar.

*"Here we go again."*
*"I knew this would happen."*
*"I have to get out."*
*"I need to fix this."*
*"They are going to leave."*

Then you did the thing. The pattern. The behavior you swore you would not do again. You disappeared. You apologized for existing. You picked a fight. You chased someone harmful. You stayed when you should have left. You deflected. You froze. You destroyed something good. You exploded.

The pattern ran. Start to finish. Three seconds to three minutes. Automatic.

And now you are here.

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

**Step 1: Name it.**

Say out loud: "A pattern just ran."

Not "I screwed up." Not "I am terrible." Not "Why do I always do this."

A pattern ran. That is what happened. Data, not judgment.

**Step 2: Locate your body.**

Where is the sensation right now? Chest. Stomach. Throat. Hands. Head. Find it. Put your hand on it if you can.

That sensation is your body signature. It is the alarm system the pattern uses. It fired. You felt it. Now you are naming it. That is recognition.

**Step 3: Decide what happens next.**

You have three options:

**Option A:** You are in crisis. Someone is unsafe (including you). Go to **Section 0.4: Crisis Triage** right now.

**Option B:** You just ran the pattern and you need to stabilize. Go to **Section 0.2: 5-Minute Emergency Protocol** right now.

**Option C:** You are stable but shaken. You want to understand what just happened. Go to **Section 0.3: Which Pattern** to identify your pattern.

## ONE MORE THING

You are going to want to fix this immediately. To read the whole book tonight. To overhaul your entire life by Tuesday.

That is another pattern. The urgency pattern. The "if I just try hard enough fast enough" pattern.

Do not do that.

Read one section. Do one thing. That is enough for right now.

The pattern took years to install. It does not uninstall in one night. But it can be interrupted tomorrow. And the day after that. And the day after that.

You are here. That is the first step. It is the only step that matters today.

The pattern ran. You noticed. That is not failure.
That is the beginning of the end of automatic.
