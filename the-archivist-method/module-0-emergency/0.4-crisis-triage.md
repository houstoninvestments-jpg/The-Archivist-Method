# 0.4 CRISIS TRIAGE

This section exists because some patterns create danger. Real danger. Not metaphorical.

Read this if:
- You are thinking about hurting yourself.
- Someone is hurting you.
- You are about to do something that cannot be undone.
- You are not safe right now.

## IF YOU ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

**Call 988** (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, US). Call or text. 24/7.

**Call 911** if someone is physically harming you or you are about to harm yourself.

**Text HOME to 741741** (Crisis Text Line) if you cannot speak.

**Go to your nearest emergency room** if you need to be somewhere safe right now.

This book is not a replacement for emergency services. Use them.

## IF YOU ARE SAFE BUT ACTIVATED

Your pattern ran and the fallout is severe. Relationship may be ending. You said something you cannot take back. You are in a shame spiral. You want to disappear.

You are activated. You are not in danger. There is a difference.

**Do this:**

1. Complete the 5-Minute Emergency Protocol (Section 0.2).
2. Do not make any major decisions for 24 hours.
3. Tell one person what happened. Text is fine. "I had a rough night. I am okay but I am not great."
4. Sleep if you can. Your nervous system needs downtime.
5. Come back to this book tomorrow.

## IF YOUR PATTERN INVOLVES SOMEONE ELSE'S SAFETY

**The Rage Pattern** can put others at risk. If your pattern involves:
- Physical violence toward others
- Verbal abuse that is escalating
- Destroying property
- Threats

You need professional support. Not instead of this book. In addition to it.

This system teaches pattern interruption. It does not replace anger management programs, domestic violence intervention, or therapy for severe trauma responses.

**National Domestic Violence Hotline:** 1-800-799-7233
**SAMHSA Helpline:** 1-800-662-4357

## IF YOUR PATTERN KEEPS YOU IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION

**The Draining Bond** can keep you in situations where you are being harmed. If you are:
- In a relationship with someone who hurts you physically
- Being controlled, isolated, or financially trapped
- Afraid to leave because of what they might do

Your safety comes first. Before pattern work. Before self-improvement. Before everything.

Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline: **1-800-799-7233**. They help you make a safety plan. They do not judge you for staying until now.

## WHEN THIS BOOK IS NOT ENOUGH

This book works for behavioral pattern interruption. It does not treat:

- Active addiction (get sober first, then do pattern work)
- Psychosis or severe mental illness (medical treatment first)
- Active abuse situations (safety first)
- Suicidal ideation (crisis support first)
- Complex PTSD requiring professional trauma processing

**This book + therapy is stronger than either alone.**

If you are in therapy, bring this book to your therapist. The frameworks are compatible. Your therapist can help with excavation (Module 2, Door 2) in ways a book cannot.

You are still here. That counts. Come back when you are ready.
