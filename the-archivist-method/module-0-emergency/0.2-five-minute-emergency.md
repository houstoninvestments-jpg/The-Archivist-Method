# 0.2 FIVE-MINUTE EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

Your pattern just ran. You are activated. Your body is still in it.

This protocol takes five minutes. Follow it exactly.

---

## MINUTE 1: GROUND

You are in your body but your body thinks it is somewhere else. Somewhere old. Somewhere dangerous. Bring it back to now.

**Do this:**

Put both feet flat on the floor. Press down. Feel the ground.

Name five things you can see. Say them out loud. Not in your head. Out loud.

"I see a wall. I see a lamp. I see my phone. I see a window. I see my hands."

Your nervous system needs proof that you are here. Not there. Here.

---

## MINUTE 2: BREATHE (BOX BREATHING)

Your autonomic nervous system is running the show right now. Override it manually.

**Do this:**

- Inhale for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds.
- Exhale for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds.

Repeat 4 times. That is 64 seconds.

This is not meditation. This is a manual override of your fight-flight-freeze-fawn response. Your vagus nerve responds to extended exhale. You are telling your body: the threat is not here.

---

## MINUTE 3: NAME THE PATTERN

You do not need to know the exact pattern yet. You just need to separate yourself from it.

**Say out loud:**

"A pattern just ran through me. I am not the pattern. The pattern is a program. It activated. It executed. I am the one watching it."

This sounds strange. Do it anyway. Your brain needs to hear the distinction between you and the automatic behavior. Identity and program are different things.

If you know which pattern ran, name it:

"The Disappearing Pattern just ran."
"The Apology Loop just ran."
"The Testing Pattern just ran."

If you do not know which one, say:

"A pattern ran. I do not know which one yet. I will find out."

---

## MINUTE 4: ASSESS THE DAMAGE

Not to shame yourself. To collect data.

Answer these three questions. Write them down if you can:

**1. What did the pattern make me do?**
(Specific behavior. "I ghosted." "I apologized six times." "I picked a fight about nothing.")

**2. What did it cost?**
(Immediate cost. "Partner is upset." "I left a meeting." "I said something cruel.")

**3. Is there something I need to do right now to limit damage?**
(Send a text. Make a call. Not send a text. Not make a call. Sometimes the best damage control is doing nothing for 24 hours.)

⚡ QUICK WIN: DAMAGE CONTROL RULE (10 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
If you are unsure whether to act right now: wait.
Patterns love urgency. "I need to fix this NOW" is
the pattern talking. If no one is in danger, wait
24 hours before making any major decisions.

## MINUTE 5: SET ONE MICRO-INTENTION

Not a goal. Not a resolution. Not a promise to change your entire life.

One micro-intention for the next 24 hours.

Pick one:

- "I will notice the next time my chest tightens."
- "I will pause for 3 seconds before I apologize."
- "I will not send that text until tomorrow."
- "I will say 'a pattern is running' the next time I feel the urge."

Say it out loud. Write it on your hand if you need to. Put it in your phone.

One intention. Twenty-four hours. That is the scope.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

You just completed a 5-minute stabilization protocol. Your nervous system should be slightly calmer. Not calm. Calmer.

Here is what you do now:

**If you are in crisis:** Go to Section 0.4.

**If you want to identify your pattern:** Go to Section 0.3.

**If you need to stop reading and go deal with your life:** Go deal with your life. Come back tomorrow. The book will be here.

**If you want to understand the system:** Start at Module 1.

There is no wrong next step except quitting entirely.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Five minutes of protocol after a pattern runs is worth
more than five years of wishing the pattern would stop.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Ground first. Breathe second. Name third. Assess fourth. Intend fifth.
• You are not the pattern. You are the one observing it.
• Urgency after a pattern runs is usually the pattern still talking.
• One micro-intention for 24 hours. That is the right scope.
• Coming back tomorrow counts as progress.
