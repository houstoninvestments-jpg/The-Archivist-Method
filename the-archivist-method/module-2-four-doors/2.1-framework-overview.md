# 2.1 THE FOUR DOORS - FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

Every pattern has four doors. Each door opens a different room. Each room gives you a different tool.

You do not have to open all four doors. Doors 1 and 3 are enough to interrupt any pattern. Doors 2 and 4 go deeper. They are optional. They are powerful. But they are not required.

Here is the framework.

## HOW THE DOORS WORK TOGETHER

**Door 1 (Recognition)** makes the pattern visible. You cannot interrupt what you cannot see. Recognition is the flashlight in a dark room. Once you know your triggers, body signatures, and automatic thoughts, you can see the pattern coming before it completes.

**Door 2 (Excavation)** explains the pattern's origin. Why it was written. When it was installed. What survival logic it followed. This door is powerful but optional. You can interrupt a circuit without knowing its origin, the same way you can stop a car without understanding the engine.

**Door 3 (Interruption)** gives you the Circuit Break. A specific verbal and physical intervention that disrupts the circuit between trigger and behavior. This is the mechanical core of the system. This is where the pattern actually stops running.

**Door 4 (Override)** gives you a replacement. The pattern served a survival need. If you interrupt the pattern without meeting the need, the pressure builds and the pattern runs harder next time. The Override gives you a new behavior that meets the same need without the destruction.

---

## THE MINIMUM VIABLE SYSTEM

If you want the fastest path to your first interrupt:

**Door 1 + Door 3.**

Learn your triggers and body signatures (Recognition). Learn the Circuit Break for your pattern (Interruption). Use it. That is enough to interrupt the circuit.

Door 2 and Door 4 make the system more durable. They deepen understanding and provide sustainable replacements. But they are not required for the first interrupt.

Some people never open Door 2. That is fine. Excavation can trigger its own activation, especially for trauma survivors. The system works without it.

Some people skip Door 4 initially and add it later once they have consistent interrupts. Also fine. The Override is about sustainability, not urgency.

**The point:** do not let completionism stop you from starting. Doors 1 and 3 are enough to begin.

---

## THE ORDER

You can open the doors in any order that works for you. But the recommended sequence is:

**1 → 3 → 4 → 2**

Not the numerical order. Here is why.

**Door 1 first** because you need to see the pattern before you can do anything about it. This is always step one.

**Door 3 second** because interruption is the most urgent need. You came here because the pattern is running your life. Stop it first. Understand it later.

**Door 4 third** because once you can interrupt, you need a replacement. Without a replacement, the survival need pushes the pattern back online.

**Door 2 last** because excavation requires stability. Going into the Original Room while the pattern is still running unchecked is risky. Stabilize first (Doors 1, 3, 4), then excavate if you choose to.

This is a recommendation, not a rule. If you want to understand origin first, open Door 2 before Door 3. But read the safety protocols in Section 2.3 first.

## WHAT EACH DOOR GIVES YOU

| Door | What You Get | Time to Learn | Required? |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1. Recognition | Trigger list, body signature map, automatic thought log | 1-3 days of observation | Yes |
| 2. Excavation | Origin story, installation event, survival logic | 1-2 hours (do with therapist if available) | No |
| 3. Interruption | Circuit Break script, Gap identification, interrupt protocol | 30 minutes to learn, 7 days to practice | Yes |
| 4. Override | Replacement behavior, graduated scripts, practice protocol | 1-2 weeks to feel natural | Recommended |

## THE CIRCUIT (HOW EVERY PATTERN RUNS)

Before we go through each door, you need to understand the circuit. Every pattern runs the same sequence. Every time. Without exception.

```
TRIGGER
   ↓ (0-2 seconds)
BODY SIGNATURE
   ↓ (1-3 seconds)
AUTOMATIC THOUGHT
   ↓
═══════════════════
⚠️  THE GAP  ⚠️
═══════════════════
   ↓ (3-7 seconds post-trigger)
BEHAVIOR
   ↓
RELIEF
   ↓
REINFORCEMENT
```

**Trigger:** Something external. A word, a tone, a silence, a situation. It matches a file in your archive. Pattern activates.

**Body signature:** Your body responds before your brain catches up. Chest tightness. Stomach drop. Heat. Throat closing. This is your nervous system recognizing the pattern's activation signal.

**Automatic thought:** A thought appears. Not one you chose. One that was installed with the pattern. "I need to get out." "I should apologize." "They are going to leave." Fast. Automatic. Feels like truth.

**The Gap:** This is where everything happens. After the automatic thought and before the behavior, there is a window. Three to seven seconds for most patterns. Less than three for the Rage Pattern. But it exists. It is real. And it is the only place where interruption is possible.

**Behavior:** The pattern's action. Disappear. Apologize. Test. Chase harm. Stay. Deflect. Freeze. Sabotage. Explode. This runs automatically if the Gap closes without interruption.

**Relief:** The behavior produces short-term relief. The tension drops. The threat feels managed. This relief is real, and it is what makes the pattern so persistent. It works. Briefly.

**Reinforcement:** The relief teaches the brain: this behavior reduced the threat. File updated. Pattern strengthened. Next time the trigger fires, the pattern runs faster, stronger, more automatically. This is why patterns get worse over time, not better.

## WHY THE GAP MATTERS

The Gap is everything.

Your trigger is not under your control. You cannot prevent your boss's tone of voice, your partner's request for closeness, or your deadline from arriving.

Your body signature is not under your control. You cannot prevent your chest from tightening or your heart from racing. The autonomic nervous system does not take requests.

Your automatic thought is not under your control. It was installed decades ago. It fires automatically. You did not choose it.

But the Gap is a window. A crack. A moment where the automatic sequence has not yet completed. Where you can insert something—a word, a breath, a script—that disrupts the circuit before the behavior executes.

Every tool in this system—every Circuit Break, every Override, every protocol—is designed to fit inside the Gap.

Three to seven seconds. That is your window. That is where you do the work.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The pattern controls the trigger, the body, and
the thought. It does not control the Gap. The Gap
is yours. Three seconds. That is enough.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
"Most people spend years trying to prevent the trigger
or change the thought. Both are upstream of where the
work actually happens. The work happens in the Gap.
Only in the Gap. Everything else is theory."

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Four Doors: Recognition, Excavation, Interruption, Override.
• Minimum viable system: Door 1 (see it) + Door 3 (stop it).
• Recommended order: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2.
• Every pattern runs the same circuit: Trigger → Body → Thought → Gap → Behavior.
• The Gap is the only place interruption is possible. 3-7 seconds.
• Excavation (Door 2) is optional. The system works without it.
• Do not let completionism prevent you from starting.
