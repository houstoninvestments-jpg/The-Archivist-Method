# 4.5 WEEKS 9-12: OVERRIDE PHASE

## Door Four: Installing New Defaults

You have seen the pattern. You understand its origin. You have broken the circuit in real time. Now you install new behavior—not to replace the pattern permanently (that takes longer than 90 days) but to create a reliable alternative. The goal of Phase 4 is not eliminating the old program. It is proving that a new program can run.

---

## Week 9: Level 1 Overrides

Level 1 Overrides are the smallest possible new behaviors. They are designed to be achievable even when the pattern is active at moderate intensity.

**Your pattern's Level 1 Override:** (Refer to your pattern's Override section, 1.9 through 9.9)

Execute this override at least three times during Week 9.

**Protocol:**
1. Recognize the activation.
2. Use the Circuit Break (full or short version).
3. Execute the Level 1 Override.
4. Sit with the discomfort. It will come. Let it exist without undoing the override.
5. Log it.

**Critical instruction:** Do not undo the override. The pattern will produce immediate regret, guilt, anxiety, or wrongness after you execute the new behavior. This is the extinction burst—the pattern's last attempt to reassert control. If you undo the override ("I should not have said that," "Let me go back and apologize," "Actually, never mind"), the pattern wins and reinforces itself.

Hold the new behavior for at least one hour before evaluating it. Most post-override discomfort dissolves within 30-60 minutes.

## Week 10: Level 2 + The Witness

Level 2 Overrides increase the stakes. They involve another person or a higher-visibility behavior.

**New element: The Witness.**

Tell one person what you are working on. This is not optional. It is structural.

The witness serves three functions:
1. **Accountability:** Someone knows. The pattern cannot hide.
2. **Reality check:** When the pattern says "you are making this up" or "it is not that bad," the witness confirms: "No, I have seen it. It is real."
3. **Support:** Override is uncomfortable. Having one person who understands why you are acting differently reduces the friction.

**Choosing your witness:**
- Someone you trust
- Someone who will not judge or pathologize
- Someone who can tolerate your discomfort without trying to fix it
- Not necessarily your closest person—sometimes a friend is better than a partner for this role

**What to say:**
"I have identified a behavioral pattern I want to change. It is called [name]. When it activates, I [behavior]. I am learning to do [override] instead. I may need to tell you when it is happening. I do not need you to fix it. I just need you to know."

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The conversation with your witness will feel
disproportionately difficult. You are
describing a vulnerability to another person
in specific, named terms. This is the opposite
of what most patterns want. Completing this
conversation is itself an override—regardless
of which pattern you run.

## Week 11: Level 3 (If Ready)

Level 3 Overrides involve higher vulnerability, larger stakes, or more public behavior change. Not everyone will be ready for Level 3 in Week 11. That is fine.

**Readiness check:**
- Have you completed at least 5 Level 1 overrides? Yes / No
- Have you completed at least 3 Level 2 overrides? Yes / No
- Have you told your witness? Yes / No
- Can you tolerate post-override discomfort without undoing the behavior? Most of the time / No

If you answered yes to 3 or more: try Level 3.
If not: repeat Level 2 with gradually increasing stakes. There is no deadline. There is only the protocol.

## Week 12: Review and Reset

Week 12 is not a graduation. It is a checkpoint.

**The 90-Day Review:**

Answer these questions honestly. Write the answers. Do not just think them.

1. **Recognition:** Can I reliably identify when my pattern activates? (Rate 1-10)
2. **Speed:** How quickly do I catch it? (Seconds / Minutes / Hours / Days)
3. **Excavation:** Do I understand where this pattern came from? (Y/N)
4. **Interruption:** Can I use the Circuit Break in real time? (Rate 1-10)
5. **Success rate:** What percentage of activations do I successfully interrupt? (Estimate)
6. **Override:** Have I executed new behavior in real situations? (How many times?)
7. **Impact:** Has the pattern's cost decreased? (Rate change 1-10)
8. **Support:** Am I using a witness and/or professional support? (Y/N)

**Scoring:**
- If your overall trajectory is upward—even slightly—the protocol is working. Continue.
- If you are stuck at a particular phase, repeat it. Add professional support if you have not already.
- If you have regressed, this is normal after excavation. Ground yourself, revisit Phase 1, rebuild.

## What Happens After 90 Days

The 90-day protocol is the foundation. It is not the building.

**Options after Day 90:**

1. **Repeat the protocol for the same pattern.** Most patterns need 2-3 cycles of 90 days for durable change. This is not failure. This is the normal timeline for overwriting decades of programming.

2. **Begin a new pattern.** If your primary pattern is at a manageable level, you may choose to start the 90-day protocol for a secondary pattern. Do not work on more than two patterns simultaneously.

3. **Shift to maintenance.** Continue daily tracking and weekly check-ins but reduce the intensity. Use the Circuit Break as needed. This is the long-term rhythm.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
After 90 days, you will not be "cured." The
pattern will still activate. The difference: you
will see it activate. You will have a name for
it. You will have a tool to interrupt it. And
you will have proof—in your own logged data—
that the circuit can be broken. That proof is
the most valuable thing you own. It is the
evidence that you are not your pattern. Keep it.
