# 4.1 THE 90-DAY MAP

## Your Pattern Interruption Protocol

You have identified your pattern. You understand the circuit. You know what it costs. Now you need a protocol. Not inspiration. Not motivation. A protocol.

This is the 90-day map. It is not negotiable. It is not flexible. It is not something you modify to suit your schedule. It is a structure designed to interrupt a program that has been running for decades. The program is organized. Your response must be more organized.

---

## The Four Phases

The 90 days break into four phases. Each phase corresponds to one of the Four Doors:

| Phase | Weeks | Door | Focus | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|-------|------|
| 1 | 1-2 | Recognition | See the pattern | Catch 3 activations per week |
| 2 | 3-4 | Excavation | Understand the origin | Complete your Archaeology Report |
| 3 | 5-8 | Interruption | Break the circuit | Use Circuit Break in real time |
| 4 | 9-12 | Override | Install new behavior | Execute Override Scripts in live situations |

---

## Phase 1: Recognition (Weeks 1-2)

**Objective:** See the pattern in real time. Not after. Not the next day. In the moment it activates.

**Daily requirement:** 5 minutes of tracking. Use the Pattern Execution Log from your pattern's section.

**Week 1 goal:** Catch at least one activation per day, even if it is retroactive (noticing after the fact).

**Week 2 goal:** Catch at least one activation in real time—while it is happening. You do not need to interrupt it yet. Just see it.

**What success looks like:** By the end of Week 2, you can say: "The pattern activated at 3 PM when my partner asked where I was going. I felt chest tightness. I noticed the urge to [pattern behavior]. I did not interrupt it, but I saw it."

Seeing it is the first victory. The pattern has operated invisibly for decades. Making it visible is a structural change, not a small one.

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Set three daily alarms on your phone: morning,
afternoon, evening. When each alarm rings, ask
one question: "Did the pattern activate since
my last check?" Answer yes or no. Log it. This
takes 15 seconds per check. After 14 days you
will have a recognition map.

## Phase 2: Excavation (Weeks 3-4)

**Objective:** Understand where the pattern was installed. Complete your Pattern Archaeology Report.

**Week 3:** Read the Pattern Archaeology section for your pattern. Begin your own excavation. Work backward: current activation → first adult memory → adolescent echo → childhood origin.

**Week 4:** Write your Archaeology Report. Name the installer. Name the original threat. Name the survival logic. Name what is outdated.

**What success looks like:** A completed Archaeology Report that you can read without being destabilized. Understanding—not just intellectually, but in your body—that the pattern was a survival strategy that is no longer needed.

**Safety note:** If excavation surfaces material that overwhelms you, stop. Use the Emergency Protocol (Module 0). Consider working with a therapist for this phase. Excavation with professional support is not weakness. It is engineering.

---

## Phase 3: Interruption (Weeks 5-8)

**Objective:** Use the Circuit Break in real time. Not perfectly. Not every time. But enough to prove it works.

**Week 5:** Practice the Circuit Break out loud, alone, twice daily. Morning and evening. Say the full script. Get comfortable with the words.

**Week 6:** Use the Circuit Break during a low-stakes activation. Not the biggest trigger—a small one. A 3/10 activation, not a 9/10.

**Week 7:** Use the Circuit Break during a moderate activation (5-6/10). Track what happens. The pattern will resist. Your body will resist. Do it anyway.

**Week 8:** Use the Circuit Break at least three times during the week, at any intensity level. Track success rate.

**What success looks like:** By Week 8, you have used the Circuit Break at least 5-10 times in real situations. Your success rate does not need to be 100%. It needs to be above 0%. One successful interrupt proves the circuit can be broken. The rest is practice.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The first successful Circuit Break will feel
wrong. Your body will protest. Your mind will
say you are being ridiculous. The discomfort is
not evidence of failure. It is evidence that the
program is losing control. Programs do not
relinquish power gracefully. They fight. Your
discomfort is the sound of the fight.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## Phase 4: Override (Weeks 9-12)

**Objective:** Execute Override Scripts in live situations. Begin installing new behavioral defaults.

**Week 9:** Practice Level 1 Override Scripts. These are the smallest, safest new behaviors. Execute at least three.

**Week 10:** Move to Level 2. Increase exposure. Tell one person what you are working on (your witness).

**Week 11:** Attempt Level 3 if ready. If not, repeat Level 2 with higher-stakes situations. There is no shame in staying at a level that challenges you.

**Week 12:** Review. Assess. Plan the next 90 days.

**What success looks like:** By Week 12, you have a new behavioral option that did not exist 90 days ago. You do not need to use it every time. You need to know it exists. The pattern is no longer the only option. That is the structural change.

---

## The Non-Negotiables

Every day for 90 days:

1. **5 minutes of tracking.** Log whether the pattern activated. What triggered it. What you did. This is the minimum.

2. **One moment of naming.** Say—out loud or in writing—"The pattern is active" or "The pattern is not active right now." Binary. Simple. Daily.

3. **Weekly check-in.** Use the template in Section 4.7. Ten minutes. Every week. No exceptions.

If you do only these three things for 90 days, you will be in a fundamentally different relationship with your pattern. Not cured. Not done. Different. And different is the beginning of free.

---

## What to Expect

**Weeks 1-2:** Awareness increase. You will see the pattern everywhere. This can feel worse before it feels better. You are not getting worse. You are getting accurate.

**Weeks 3-4:** Emotional material may surface during excavation. This is normal. Use support structures.

**Weeks 5-8:** The hardest phase. Interruption requires acting against the program in real time. Expect resistance, discomfort, and temporary failure. All normal.

**Weeks 9-12:** Relief. Not complete freedom—but the first sustained experience of choosing differently. This is where hope becomes evidence.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• 90 days. Four phases. One pattern at a time.
• Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): See it. Recognition.
• Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Understand it. Excavation.
• Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Break it. Interruption.
• Phase 4 (Weeks 9-12): Replace it. Override.
• Non-negotiables: 5 min tracking, daily naming, weekly check-in.
• The only way to fail: quit before Day 90.
