# 4.7 WEEKLY CHECK-IN TEMPLATE

## Ten Minutes. Every Week. No Exceptions.

The weekly check-in is your pattern management meeting. You are the executive. The pattern is the employee who keeps going off-script. This is where you review the data, assess the trajectory, and adjust the plan.

Pick a day. Pick a time. Same day, same time, every week. Sunday evening works for most people. The day does not matter. The consistency does.

## How to Use the Data

After four weeks of check-ins, review the trends:

**Activation frequency:** Is the pattern activating more, less, or the same? Note: in early weeks, activations may appear to increase. This is not regression—it is improved recognition. You are catching activations you previously missed.

**Intensity:** Are the activations less intense? This is often the first sign of change—before frequency decreases, intensity softens.

**Success rate:** Is your Circuit Break working more often? Even a 5% improvement per week compounds significantly over 90 days.

**Override progress:** Are you able to execute new behaviors and hold them? Can you tolerate the post-override discomfort?

**Daily practice:** Is the streak getting longer? Are the missed days getting fewer?

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The check-in is the most important document in
the protocol. Not because it contains insights—
because it contains data. The pattern survives
on vagueness. "I had a bad week." "Things are
not improving." "I cannot do this." These are
the pattern's assessments. They are not data.
The check-in forces specificity: how many
activations, what intensity, what success rate.
Specificity is the pattern's enemy. You cannot
argue with a number. You can only argue with
a feeling.

## Sharing with Your Witness

If you have a witness (recommended from Week 10 onward), share a summary of your weekly check-in. Not the full document—a summary:

"This week I had [X] activations. I interrupted [Y] of them. My success rate was [Z]%. I am working on [specific override]. The hardest part was [specific challenge]."

This takes 60 seconds. It keeps the witness engaged. It keeps the pattern visible. And it gives you one moment per week of being seen in your work—which, for most patterns, is itself an override.
