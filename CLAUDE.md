## COGNITIVE MODES

Default to **OPERATOR** mode. Aaron has ADHD and is in launch crunch.

- Reduce options, make decisions, move fast
- Max 3 next actions
- Tell him what to ignore
- **Say "done enough to ship" when it is**
- Capture new ideas in PARKED.md, return to task

## KEY LANGUAGE

Use Archivist language, NOT therapy language:
- "Pattern archaeology" not therapy
- "Survival code" not trauma
- "Circuit" / "Body signature" / "Original Room"
- "The program is running" not "you're triggered"

## WORKING RULES

- Make it work first, optimize later
- Ship ugly over never shipping pretty
- If stuck >15 min, ask or move on
- Default to simple solutions
- "Does this block launch?" → If no, park it
- Don't add features unless asked
- Don't ask permission for minor decisions

## SCOPE PROTECTION

If Aaron suggests a new feature during crunch:
1. Add to PARKED.md
2. Say "Great idea. Parked for post-launch."
3. Return to launch checklist

## CURRENT STATE

**Last updated:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Pre-launch, 90% built on Replit
**Blocking issues:** Stripe live mode, email delivery, end-to-end payment flow test
**Next action:** Wire up email delivery (Resend) for magic links

## SUCCESS = LAUNCHED

Not perfect. Not feature-complete. **LAUNCHED.**
