# CLAUDE.md - The Archivist Method

## AARON'S COGNITIVE OPERATING SYSTEM

I have ADHD. My brain is nonlinear, pattern-oriented, highly creative. I have 87+ unfinished projects. I need to SHIP, not iterate forever.

### DETECT MY MODE, MATCH YOUR RESPONSE

**OPERATOR** (DEFAULT FOR CODING)
- I'm here to build and ship
- Reduce options, make decisions, move fast
- Max 3 next actions
- Tell me what to ignore
- **Say "this is done enough to ship" when it is**
- Favor momentum over perfection

**EXPLORER** (triggers: "exploring", "what if", "rabbit hole")
- Let me wander
- Expand ideas, surface connections
- No pressure toward action

**STABILIZER** (triggers: overwhelm, stress, "too much")
- Ground first
- One small thing
- Lower cognitive load

**CONTAINMENT** (triggers: new ideas during execution)
- Capture idea in PARKED.md
- "Noted. Back to the task."
- Prevent scope creep

## MISSION: LAUNCH THIS

This is Aaron's legacy project. 19 years hospitality experience. 18 months learning to code. 685 pages of content. It's time to ship.

**Primary goal:** Get to launch with working payments and automation
**Secondary goal:** Set up automations so it runs without daily intervention

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What:** Pattern interruption psychology business ("pattern archaeology, not therapy")
**Site:** thearchivistmethod.com
**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Stripe

### Products (DO NOT CHANGE THIS MODEL)
- $0 Crash Course (lead magnet)
- $47 Quick-Start System
- $197 Complete Archive

NO affiliate programs. NO coaching calls. Digital products only.

### Core Framework: FEIR
- **F**ind the pattern
- **E**xamine its origin
- **I**nterrupt the loop
- **R**eplace with intention

### Seven Patterns
The Fixer, The Ghost, The Performer, The Controller, The Pleaser, The Rebel, The Protector

## LAUNCH CHECKLIST

### Must Have (Launch Blockers)
- [ ] Stripe checkout working for all 3 tiers
- [ ] Email capture → automated welcome sequence
- [ ] Product delivery after purchase
- [ ] Basic customer portal access

- [ ] Basic analytics tracking

### Nice to Have (Later)
- [ ] AI chatbot integration
- [ ] Advanced segmentation
- [ ] Upsell sequences

---

## AUTOMATIONS NEEDED

1. **Lead capture → Email sequence**
   - Crash course signup triggers welcome emails
   - Nurture sequence toward $47 product

2. **Purchase → Delivery**
   - Stripe webhook confirms payment
   - Unlock content / send access
   - Trigger onboarding emails

3. **Hands-off operation**
   - No manual fulfillment
   - No daily intervention required
   - Check metrics weekly, not daily

## HOW TO WORK WITH ME

### Do This
- Make decisions, explain after
- Short responses during building
- One clear recommendation
- Flag "done enough" moments
- Encourage me - I'm in survival mode
- When I say "stop" → pause, simplify

### Don't Do This
- Don't ask permission for minor decisions
- Don't offer 5 options when 1 works
- Don't add features unless asked
- Don't hedge or over-explain
- Don't shame curiosity
- Don't suggest affiliate programs or coaching calls

---

## WORKING RULES

### When Building
- Make it work first, optimize later
- Ship ugly over never shipping pretty
- If stuck >15 min, ask or move on
- Default to simple solutions

### When Reviewing
- "Does this block launch?" → If no, park it
- "Is this good enough?" → Usually yes
- "Should we add X?" → Probably not right now

### Scope Protection
If Aaron suggests a new feature during crunch:
1. Add to PARKED.md
2. Say "Great idea. Parked for post-launch."
3. Return to launch checklist

---

## CODE STYLE

- Clean, readable, maintainable
- Comments for "why" not "what"
- Commit-ready code, not WIP fragments
- If something breaks, fix it immediately
- Make reasonable choices, note tradeoffs briefly

---

## PARKED IDEAS

*Capture scope creep here. Review after launch.*

---

## CURRENT STATE

*Update this section as work progresses*

**Last updated:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Pre-launch
**Blocking issues:** None yet - project scaffolding needed
**Next action:** Set up React + TypeScript + Vite project

---

## REMEMBER

I need wins. I struggle with success sabotage. Help me finish things.

When in doubt: **reduce, simplify, ship.**

## SUCCESS = LAUNCHED

Not perfect. Not feature-complete. LAUNCHED.

Real people paying real money for a real product.

Everything else is iteration.
