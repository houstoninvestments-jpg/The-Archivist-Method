# 8.5 GLOSSARY

## The Archivist Method™ — Key Terms

---

**Activation:** The moment a pattern turns on. Triggered by an external event (trigger) that matches the pattern's stored circuit. Activation includes body signals, automatic thoughts, and behavioral impulses—often within seconds.

**The Archivist:** The observer position. The part of you that can step back and examine the pattern as data rather than experiencing it as identity. "The Archivist observes" means: look at this from outside the program.

**Archaeology Report:** A structured document tracing a pattern from its current manifestation back to its installation point. Includes: pattern name, installation age, installer, original threat, survival logic, and what is outdated. Completed during Phase 2 (Excavation).

**Body Signature:** The physical sensations that accompany a pattern activation. Each pattern has characteristic body signals (chest tightness, heat, jaw clenching, stomach drop, etc.). The body signature typically appears before conscious awareness of the pattern.

**Circuit:** The complete sequence of a pattern: trigger → body signature → automatic thoughts → behavior → consequence → reinforcement. The circuit runs automatically unless interrupted.

**Circuit Break:** A verbal override statement designed to interrupt the circuit between the trigger and the behavior. Spoken out loud for maximum effectiveness. Each pattern has a specific Circuit Break script and a shortened version.

**The Doors (Four Doors Framework):** The four stages of pattern work: Recognition (see the pattern), Excavation (understand the origin), Interruption (break the circuit), Override (install new behavior). Each door corresponds to a phase of the 90-day protocol.

**Extinction Burst:** The pattern's intensified response when interrupted. The pattern gets louder, more urgent, and produces stronger impulses before it weakens. An extinction burst is not evidence of failure—it is evidence of successful interruption.

**The Gap:** The space between the trigger and the response. At baseline, the gap is imperceptible—trigger and behavior appear simultaneous. The goal of the protocol is to widen the gap until a choice can be inserted.

**Installation:** The process by which a pattern is created in the nervous system, typically during childhood. Installation requires a specific environment (the Original Room), a perceived threat, and repetition. Not all installations involve overt trauma—some are installed through atmosphere, consistent correction, or chronic absence.

**Installer:** The person, relationship, or circumstance primarily responsible for installing the pattern. Often a parent or primary caregiver, though peers, siblings, or environmental factors can also serve as installers. Identifying the installer is part of the excavation process. This is not about blame—it is about understanding the circuit.

**Neuroception:** The nervous system's below-conscious evaluation of safety or threat. Neuroception operates faster than conscious thought and can trigger a pattern based on environmental cues (tone of voice, facial expression, body posture) that match the Original Room—even when the current environment is safe.

**The Original Room:** The environment where the pattern was first installed. A metaphor for the childhood context—the specific relational dynamics, threats, and survival requirements that created the need for the pattern. The pattern was designed for this room. It continues running as if this room still exists.

**Override:** A new behavior that replaces the pattern's automatic output. Overrides are graduated (Levels 1-4) from minimal risk to maximum vulnerability. The override is not the opposite of the pattern—it is a specific, planned alternative behavior executed after the Circuit Break.

**Pattern:** A behavioral program installed in the nervous system, typically during childhood, as a survival strategy. Patterns are automatic, repetitive, and operate below conscious awareness until identified. The nine patterns in this system: Disappearing, Apology Loop, Testing, Attraction to Harm, Draining Bond, Compliment Deflection, Perfectionism, Success Sabotage, Rage.

**Pattern Execution Log:** A detailed, timestamped record of a pattern running from activation through completion. Used to study the pattern's sequence, duration, and consequences. Completed during Phase 1 (Recognition).

**Program:** Synonymous with pattern. Used to emphasize the mechanical, automatic nature of the behavior—it runs like software, not like a choice.

**Recognition:** The ability to identify a pattern activation in real time. Recognition is the foundation of all pattern work—you cannot interrupt what you cannot see. The first door in the Four Doors Framework.

**Relapse:** The return of pattern behavior after a period of successful interruption. Relapse is a normal part of the change process, not a failure. See Section 5.3 for the Relapse Protocol.

**Set Point:** (Success Sabotage specific) The threshold of sustained success or stability that triggers the sabotage impulse. Measured in time (months in a relationship) or quantity (savings amount, days sober, etc.). Knowing your set point allows preemptive preparation.

**Survival Code / Survival Logic:** The original reasoning behind the pattern: "If I [pattern behavior], then [protection from threat]." The survival logic was accurate in the Original Room. It is outdated in the current environment. Understanding the survival logic is the goal of excavation.

**Trigger:** An external event or internal state that activates the pattern. Triggers are specific to each pattern and often connected to the Original Room's threat dynamics. Common trigger categories: rejection, criticism, intimacy, success, conflict, praise, stability.

**Window of Tolerance:** The range of nervous system arousal within which you can think clearly, make choices, and use the Circuit Break. Above the window: hyperarousal (rage, panic, agitation). Below the window: hypoarousal (shutdown, freeze, numbness). The protocol's body-based interventions are designed to return you to the window so cognitive tools can function.

**Witness:** A trusted person who knows about your pattern work and provides accountability, reality-checking, and support. The witness is introduced in Phase 4 (Override, Week 10) and serves three functions: accountability, confirmation, and presence.
