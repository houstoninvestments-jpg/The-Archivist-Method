# 0.3 WHICH PATTERN

You run a pattern. Probably more than one. But one pattern is primary. It is the one that costs you the most. The one that runs the most often. The one you recognize immediately when you read its description.

Find it below.

## THE NINE PATTERNS

Read each description. Your body will tell you which one is yours. Do not think about it. Feel it. The one that makes your stomach tighten or your face flush—that is the one.

---

### PATTERN 1: THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN

**What it does:** When a relationship gets close, you pull away. You ghost. You cancel plans. You create distance. You end things before they can end you.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "I need space."
- "This is too much."
- "I should not have let them get this close."
- "If I leave first, it hurts less."

**What it looks like from outside:** Someone who cannot stay. Someone who runs every time it gets real. Relationships that never make it past three to six months.

**Body signature:** Chest tightness. Claustrophobic feeling. Urge to flee.

**Your pattern if:** You have a trail of people who wanted to love you and you would not let them.

---

### PATTERN 2: THE APOLOGY LOOP

**What it does:** You apologize for everything. For existing. For needing. For taking up space. For having an opinion. "Sorry" comes out of your mouth before you even know what you are sorry for.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "I am being a burden."
- "I should not have asked."
- "They are going to be annoyed with me."
- "I take up too much space."

**What it looks like from outside:** Someone who cannot ask for what they need. Someone who says sorry ten times before lunch. Someone who shrinks.

**Body signature:** Guilt. Throat tightening. Shrinking sensation. Making yourself physically smaller.

**Your pattern if:** You apologize when someone bumps into you.

---

### PATTERN 3: THE TESTING PATTERN

**What it does:** You create tests for people. If they really loved you, they would know what you need without asking. You push them away to see if they come back. You pick fights to test loyalty.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "If they cared, they would know."
- "Let me see if they will fight for me."
- "They are going to leave anyway. Let me speed it up."
- "This is going too well. Something is wrong."

**What it looks like from outside:** Someone who starts fights for no reason. Someone who creates drama right when things are calm. An exhausting partner.

**Body signature:** Panic. Heart racing. Hypervigilance. Scanning for signs of abandonment.

**Your pattern if:** You push people away and then feel devastated when they actually leave.

---

### PATTERN 4: ATTRACTION TO HARM

**What it does:** Safe people feel boring. Dangerous people feel exciting. You mistake chaos for chemistry. You are drawn to the people most likely to hurt you.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "There is no spark with the nice ones."
- "I know they are bad for me but I cannot help it."
- "The chemistry is too strong."
- "This one is different." (It is not.)

**What it looks like from outside:** Serial toxic relationships. Leaving kind partners for volatile ones. Ignoring red flags that everyone else can see.

**Body signature:** Intense excitement. "Butterflies." Obsessive thinking. What you call chemistry is your nervous system recognizing a familiar threat.

**Your pattern if:** Your friends have stopped being surprised by your relationship choices.

---

### PATTERN 5: THE DRAINING BOND

**What it does:** You stay. Long past when you should have left. In relationships, jobs, friendships, situations that drain you. Leaving feels like betrayal. Staying feels like dying slowly.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "They need me."
- "It is not that bad."
- "If I leave, I am a terrible person."
- "I can fix this if I just try harder."

**What it looks like from outside:** Someone trapped. Someone who makes excuses for people who hurt them. Someone who gives everything and has nothing left.

**Body signature:** Heavy guilt when considering leaving. Exhaustion. Obligation that feels like cement.

**Your pattern if:** Everyone around you can see you should leave except you.

---

### PATTERN 6: COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

**What it does:** Someone praises you and you cannot absorb it. You deflect. Minimize. Make a joke. Redirect to someone else. Visibility feels dangerous.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "They are just being nice."
- "If they knew the real me, they would not say that."
- "It was not that big a deal."
- "Someone else deserves this more."

**What it looks like from outside:** False modesty. Self-deprecation. Someone who will not take credit for their own work.

**Body signature:** Squirming. Discomfort. Heat in face. Urge to disappear or redirect attention.

**Your pattern if:** You have deflected every compliment you have received in the last month.

---

### PATTERN 7: THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN

**What it does:** You cannot start until conditions are perfect. You research instead of acting. You wait for the right mood, the right time, the right tool. Perfect conditions never arrive. Nothing gets finished.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "I need to do more research first."
- "I am not ready yet."
- "If I cannot do it perfectly, I should not do it at all."
- "I will start Monday."

**What it looks like from outside:** Procrastination. Endless preparation. Half-finished projects. Brilliant ideas that never materialize.

**Body signature:** Paralysis. Tension. Dread when thinking about starting. Relief when you decide to wait.

**Your pattern if:** You have more unfinished projects than finished ones.

---

### PATTERN 8: SUCCESS SABOTAGE

**What it does:** Things are going well. You are about to succeed. And then you blow it up. You quit the job before the promotion. You start a fight right when the relationship is good. You miss the deadline you could have easily met.

**What it sounds like in your head:**
- "Something bad is about to happen."
- "I do not deserve this."
- "Better to fail on my terms than succeed and lose it later."
- "Who am I to have this?"

**What it looks like from outside:** Explosive anger. Intimidation. Cruelty. The aftermath of shame and apologies.

**Body signature:** Flooding. Heat. Heart pounding. Tunnel vision. Hands shaking. Everything speeds up.

**Your pattern if:** People walk on eggshells around you and you hate that they have to.

## IDENTIFYING YOUR PRIMARY

Most people run two to three patterns. One is primary. The rest are secondary.

Your primary pattern is the one that:

1. **Costs you the most.** Not the most frequent—the most expensive in relationships, career, health, time.
2. **Activated most recently.** The one you just ran. The one that brought you here.
3. **Makes your body react right now.** The description you just read that made your chest tight or your face hot.

## WHAT TO DO NEXT

Go to your primary pattern in **Module 3**. Read the At-a-Glance summary. Then read Section X.1 through X.3. That is enough for Day 1.

Do not read all nine patterns. Do not read the whole book. Read yours. Start there.

If you want to understand the system first, go to **Module 1**.

If you want to start interrupting your pattern today, go to **Section X.8** (How to Interrupt) for your primary pattern.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• You run one primary pattern and possibly two to three secondary ones.
• Your body tells you which one is yours. Trust the physical response.
• Primary = highest cost, most recent activation, strongest body response.
• Start with one pattern. Master the interrupt. Add others later.
• Reading your pattern description is not the same as fixing it. Action comes next.
