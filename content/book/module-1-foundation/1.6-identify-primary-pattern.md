# 1.6 IDENTIFY YOUR PRIMARY PATTERN

You read the nine patterns. Your body responded to at least one. Probably two or three made your chest tighten, your face flush, or your stomach drop.

Now you identify the primary.

---

## THE THREE CRITERIA

Your primary pattern is not the one you run most often. It is the one that costs you the most. These are sometimes the same pattern. Sometimes they are not.

**Criterion 1: Highest cost.**

Which pattern has done the most damage to your life? Not which one activates the most—which one has cost you the most in relationships, career, health, time, and money?

Make a rough estimate. Do not overthink it. First answer that comes to mind.

The pattern that cost me the most: ________________

**Criterion 2: Most recent activation.**

Which pattern brought you here? Which one ran most recently? The one that made you pick up this book or open this file?

The pattern that ran most recently: ________________

**Criterion 3: Strongest body response.**

Go back to Section 1.5. Scan the nine patterns again. Which description made your body react the most? Not which one you intellectually agree with—which one your body responded to.

The pattern my body responded to most: ________________

## SCORING

If all three criteria point to the same pattern: that is your primary. No question.

If two out of three point to the same pattern: that is your primary.

If all three point to different patterns: go with Criterion 1. Highest cost. That is where to start because that is where interruption creates the most change.

⚡ QUICK WIN: NAME YOUR PRIMARY (30 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Write it down. Right now.

My primary pattern is: ________________

Say it out loud: "I run the [name] Pattern."

Not "I am [adjective]."
Not "I think I might have [name]."

"I run the [name] Pattern."

That sentence separates you from the code.

## THE PATTERN IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT

If you are still unsure, work through these ten questions. Answer honestly. Speed is more accurate than deliberation. First answer. Move on.

**Question 1:** When a relationship gets serious, do you pull away or lean in?
- Pull away → Disappearing Pattern
- Lean in but test them → Testing Pattern
- Lean into the wrong person → Attraction to Harm
- Lean in and cannot leave → Draining Bond

**Question 2:** When someone praises you, what is your first physical response?
- Squirm, deflect, minimize → Compliment Deflection
- Apologize for the achievement → Apology Loop
- Feel dread about being visible → Perfectionism Pattern

**Question 3:** When someone criticizes you, what happens in under 3 seconds?
- Heat, flooding, rage → Rage Pattern
- Apologize, agree, shrink → Apology Loop
- Pull away, distance → Disappearing Pattern
- "They are right, I should not succeed" → Success Sabotage

**Question 4:** When things are going well in your life, what do you feel?
- Panic, waiting for disaster → Success Sabotage
- Need to test it, poke it → Testing Pattern
- Urge to create distance → Disappearing Pattern
- Relief but guilt → Draining Bond

**Question 5:** When you need to ask for help, what happens?
- "Sorry to bother you" (automatic) → Apology Loop
- You do not ask; you wait and test if they offer → Testing Pattern
- You do not ask; you disappear first → Disappearing Pattern
- You do not ask; you should be able to do it perfectly alone → Perfectionism Pattern

**Question 6:** When you have a deadline or visible project, what is your first response?
- Paralysis, research, delay → Perfectionism Pattern
- Start but destroy it before completion → Success Sabotage
- Get angry at the person who assigned it → Rage Pattern

**Question 7:** Do you say "sorry" more than 5 times a day for things that are not your fault?
- Yes → Apology Loop (strong indicator)

**Question 8:** Do you have a history of relationships lasting less than 6 months?
- Yes, you left → Disappearing Pattern
- Yes, they left after you tested them → Testing Pattern
- Yes, they were toxic → Attraction to Harm

**Question 9:** Are you currently in a situation (relationship, job, friendship) you know you should leave but cannot?
- Yes → Draining Bond (strong indicator)

**Question 10:** Have you destroyed something good (relationship, opportunity, achievement) right before it succeeded?
- Yes → Success Sabotage (strong indicator)

## TALLYING YOUR RESULTS

Count how many questions pointed to each pattern:

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|-------|
| 1. Disappearing | ____ |
| 2. Apology Loop | ____ |
| 3. Testing | ____ |
| 4. Attraction to Harm | ____ |
| 5. Draining Bond | ____ |
| 6. Compliment Deflection | ____ |
| 7. Perfectionism | ____ |
| 8. Success Sabotage | ____ |
| 9. Rage | ____ |

The pattern with the highest count is likely your primary. Cross-reference with your three criteria from above.

## WHAT IF I HAVE MULTIPLE HIGH-SCORING PATTERNS

Normal. Most people do. Here is the rule:

**Start with one.**

The temptation is to work on all of them simultaneously. That is the pattern of someone who reads self-help books—try everything, master nothing. Do not do that.

Pick your primary. Learn its circuit. Practice the interrupt. Get one win. Then consider adding a second pattern.

The skills transfer. Once you can interrupt one circuit, you understand the mechanics. Applying them to a second pattern is faster. Applying them to a third is faster still. But the first one takes the longest because you are learning the system and interrupting a pattern simultaneously.

One pattern. Seven days. One win.

## COMMON IDENTIFICATION MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Choosing the pattern you want to have instead of the one you actually run.**

The Perfectionism Pattern sounds more flattering than the Rage Pattern. Attraction to Harm sounds more romantic than the Apology Loop. Do not pick based on how it sounds. Pick based on what your body does.

**Mistake 2: Identifying secondary patterns as primary.**

Compliment Deflection often shows up alongside Apology Loop. But if Apology Loop is destroying your career and Compliment Deflection is just uncomfortable, Apology Loop is your primary.

**Mistake 3: Choosing based on frequency instead of cost.**

You might run the Apology Loop 20 times a day and the Success Sabotage Pattern once a year. But if that once-a-year sabotage costs you a promotion, a relationship, or a year of progress, Success Sabotage is your primary.

**Mistake 4: Changing your answer after thinking too hard.**

Your first answer was right. Your body knew. Your brain is now trying to rationalize a different answer because the real one is uncomfortable. Go back to your first answer.

## YOUR PRIMARY PATTERN PROFILE

Fill this out. It is your starting document.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
MY PRIMARY PATTERN PROFILE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Primary Pattern: ________________
Secondary Pattern(s): ________________

Last activation:
  When: ________________
  Trigger: ________________
  Body signature: ________________
  What I did: ________________
  What it cost: ________________

Number of times it has activated this month: ____
Number of relationships it has affected: ____
Number of jobs/opportunities lost: ____
Years this pattern has been running: ____

One sentence summary:
"I run the _______ Pattern. It activates when
_______. It costs me _______. I am ready to
interrupt it."

## WHAT TO DO NEXT

You have your primary pattern. Go to **Module 3** and find it.

Read in this order:
1. **X.0: At-a-Glance** (2 minutes) — Summary card. Copy to phone.
2. **X.1: What It Is** (5 minutes) — Deep dive into the pattern.
3. **X.3: Pattern Markers** (5 minutes) — Learn your body signatures.
4. **X.8: How to Interrupt** (10 minutes) — Get your Circuit Break script.

That is Day 1. Thirty minutes. You will have your Circuit Break script memorized and ready to use the next time the pattern activates.

If you want the full framework first, read **Module 2: The Four Doors** before going to your pattern.

If you want to start interrupting right now, go straight to **X.8** for your pattern. Learn the script. Say it five times. You have already begun.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
"The moment you name the pattern, it loses
something. Not power—not yet. But invisibility.
It has been running in the dark. You just turned
on a light. It does not like the light."
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
You do not need to be sure. You need to be close
enough to start. Identification gets refined through
practice, not through more assessment.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Primary pattern = highest cost, most recent, strongest body response.
• Trust your body over your brain. First answer was correct.
• Start with one pattern. Skills transfer to others.
• Frequency is not the same as cost. Cost determines primary.
• Name it out loud. "I run the _____ Pattern." Naming ends invisibility.
• Go to Module 3, find your pattern, read X.0, X.1, X.3, X.8. That is Day 1.
