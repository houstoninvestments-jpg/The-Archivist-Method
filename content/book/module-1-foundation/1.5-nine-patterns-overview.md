# 1.5 THE NINE PATTERNS - OVERVIEW

Nine patterns. Nine programs running in nine different bodies. All installed the same way: a child encounters a threat, the brain writes survival code, the code never updates.

You run at least one. Probably two or three. One is primary.

Read all nine. Your body will tell you which ones are yours.

---

## PATTERN 1: THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN

**The code:** When closeness approaches, pull away. When love arrives, leave first.

**Installation:** Someone left. Or someone stayed but was not emotionally present. Or closeness was dangerous. The child learned: distance is safety. Attachment is risk. Leave before you are left.

**How it runs:** A relationship deepens. Someone says "I love you." Someone wants future plans. Someone moves closer. Your chest tightens. You feel trapped. You cancel plans. Stop responding to texts. Create arguments. Ghost. End the relationship before it can end you.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (intimacy signal) → Body (chest tightness, claustrophobia) → Thought ("I need to get out") → Behavior (create distance, leave)

**What it costs:** Chronic loneliness. Relationships that never make it past six months. A trail of people who wanted to love you and were not allowed to. The paradox: the thing you fear most (being alone) is the thing the pattern guarantees.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪

## PATTERN 2: THE APOLOGY LOOP

**The code:** Your existence is an imposition. Apologize for it constantly.

**Installation:** Needs were punished. Asking was dangerous. Taking up space drew negative attention. The child learned: I am too much. My needs are a burden. If I shrink, I survive.

**How it runs:** You need something. You want to ask for help. You have an opinion. Your throat tightens. Guilt arrives. "Sorry" exits your mouth before you know it. "Sorry for asking." "Sorry for being here." "Sorry to bother you." You minimize what you need. You take whatever you get. You never negotiate.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (needing/wanting) → Body (guilt, throat tightening) → Thought ("I am a burden") → Behavior (apologize, minimize, shrink)

**What it costs:** You are underpaid because you cannot negotiate. Your boundaries are nonexistent because you cannot state them without apologizing. Your relationships are unbalanced because you give everything and ask for nothing. Chronic burnout. Resentment you never express.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚪⚪⚪

## PATTERN 3: THE TESTING PATTERN

**The code:** People will leave. Test them to find out when.

**Installation:** Attachment was unreliable. Love was inconsistent. The caregiver was sometimes present, sometimes gone, and there was no way to predict which. The child learned: I cannot trust that people will stay. I need to test them constantly. If they fail the test, at least I know.

**How it runs:** A relationship is going well. Too well. Your nervous system does not trust "well." Something feels wrong about nothing being wrong. Heart rate increases. Hypervigilance activates. You create a test. Pick a fight about nothing. Say something designed to provoke. Pull away to see if they chase. If they pass the test, relief lasts 48 hours. Then you need to test again. If they fail the test—or simply get exhausted and leave—you have proof: people always leave.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (stability, things going well) → Body (panic, racing heart) → Thought ("This is too good; they will leave") → Behavior (create test, provoke, push away)

**What it costs:** Exhausted partners who leave not because they do not love you, but because they cannot pass one more test. Self-fulfilling prophecy: you test to see if people will leave, and the testing makes them leave. Confirmation of the exact fear the pattern was designed to prevent.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪

## PATTERN 4: ATTRACTION TO HARM

**The code:** Danger is love. Safety is boring. Chase the fire.

**Installation:** The primary caregiver was both the source of love and the source of pain. Or chaos was the norm. Or the only intense connection the child experienced came with harm. The child learned: this is what love feels like. This electricity. This unpredictability. This fear.

**How it runs:** You meet someone safe. Kind. Available. Consistent. You feel nothing. "No chemistry." You meet someone unavailable. Volatile. Running hot and cold. Red flags visible from orbit. You feel everything. Electricity. Obsession. What you call chemistry. Your body is not detecting attraction. It is detecting a familiar threat pattern and coding it as desire.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (meeting someone with familiar danger signals) → Body (excitement, "butterflies," obsessive focus) → Thought ("This is chemistry; this is the one") → Behavior (pursue, ignore red flags, leave the safe person)

**What it costs:** Serial toxic relationships. Leaving people who would have loved you well for people who love you the way you were loved as a child—inconsistently, painfully, or not at all. Years lost to people your friends warned you about. Inability to sustain healthy partnerships because health feels like nothing.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds, but the body signature is misleading. Danger feels like attraction.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪

## PATTERN 5: THE DRAINING BOND

**The code:** Leaving is betrayal. Stay until you are hollow.

**Installation:** The child was responsible for a caregiver's emotional state. Or leaving was punished with guilt, manipulation, or threat. Or the child witnessed someone leave and saw the devastation. The child learned: I must stay. No matter the cost. Leaving makes me the villain.

**How it runs:** You are in a relationship, job, or friendship that is destroying you. You know it. Everyone around you knows it. But when you think about leaving, guilt arrives like concrete. Heavy. Immobilizing. You are not staying because you want to. You are staying because the pattern will not let you leave. You tell yourself: "It is not that bad." "They need me." "If I leave, I am selfish." Meanwhile, your health declines, your energy drains, and years pass.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (considering leaving) → Body (crushing guilt, obligation) → Thought ("They need me; leaving is selfish") → Behavior (stay, absorb more harm, lose more time)

**What it costs:** Years. Sometimes decades. Your health. Your other relationships. Your career. Your sense of self. The Draining Bond does not take everything at once. It takes a little every day. By the time you notice, you are hollowed out.

**Gap duration:** Unclear. This pattern operates as a chronic state rather than an acute activation.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫

## PATTERN 6: COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION

**The code:** Visibility is danger. Achievement must be hidden. Praise is a trap.

**Installation:** Being seen was dangerous. Standing out was punished—by a sibling, a parent, a peer environment. Or praise was followed by exploitation ("You are so good at this, so you should do more"). Or visibility triggered jealousy and retaliation. The child learned: stay invisible. If they notice you, something bad follows.

**How it runs:** Someone says "Great job." Your body squirms. Heat rises in your face. You deflect: "Oh, it was nothing." "Anyone could have done it." "It was really the team." You minimize your achievement. Make a self-deprecating joke. Redirect attention to anyone else. You do this in performance reviews, in relationships, in every context where someone tries to acknowledge you.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (praise, visibility, acknowledgment) → Body (squirming, facial heat, urge to hide) → Thought ("They are just being nice; I do not deserve this") → Behavior (deflect, minimize, redirect)

**What it costs:** You are underpaid because you never take credit. You are passed over for promotions because you are invisible by design. People do not know what you are capable of because you will not let them see. Your career stalls. Your relationships lack depth because you will not let anyone see the real you, including the good parts.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚪⚪⚪

## PATTERN 7: THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN

**The code:** If it is not perfect, it is dangerous. Do not start until conditions are guaranteed.

**Installation:** Mistakes were punished. Not just corrected—punished. With criticism, disappointment, withdrawal of love, or worse. Or the child received love only for performance. Or the environment was so chaotic that controlling one thing—schoolwork, appearance, behavior—was the only power available. The child learned: imperfection is unacceptable. If I cannot guarantee the outcome, I cannot risk the attempt.

**How it runs:** You have a project. A deadline. Something that will be seen and judged. Dread arrives. Not laziness—dread. You research instead of starting. You organize your workspace instead of working. You wait for the right mood, the right time, the right conditions. They never come. The deadline passes. Or you produce something at the last minute, fueled by panic, that is actually good—but the process was agonizing. Repeat forever.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (visible task, judgment possible) → Body (paralysis, tension, dread) → Thought ("It has to be perfect; I am not ready") → Behavior (delay, research, reorganize, avoid)

**What it costs:** A graveyard of unfinished projects. Career paralysis. Things you are brilliant at that no one will ever see because you will not let them out until they are perfect. Which means never. Chronic stress from deadlines you create by waiting. The cruelest cost: you are more capable than anyone knows, including you.

**Gap duration:** Variable. Can be hours or days of paralysis before the avoidance solidifies.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪

## PATTERN 8: SUCCESS SABOTAGE

**The code:** Success is dangerous. Destroy it before it destroys you.

**Installation:** Success was punished. Achievement triggered jealousy, attack, or loss. Or the child watched a parent succeed and then lose everything. Or good things were always followed by bad things, and the child's brain wired them together: good → bad is coming. The child learned: do not succeed. If you succeed, something terrible follows. Better to fail on your terms.

**How it runs:** Things are going well. You are approaching a milestone. A promotion. A relationship deepening. A project near completion. And then dread. Not excitement—dread. "Something bad is about to happen." Your body tightens. You feel the other shoe about to drop. So you drop it yourself. Quit the job. Start a fight. Miss the deadline. Blow up the relationship. The destruction feels like relief. Briefly. Then the grief and confusion: "Why do I always do this?"

**The circuit:**
Trigger (approaching success/milestone) → Body (dread, panic, "waiting for the shoe to drop") → Thought ("Something bad is coming; I do not deserve this") → Behavior (sabotage, quit, destroy, create crisis)

**What it costs:** A life of almost. Almost promoted. Almost in love. Almost finished. Almost successful. You have proof you can do it—you get close every time. But close is where the pattern activates. So close is as far as you get. Perpetual potential without actualization. People around you are confused because they can see what you are capable of.

**Gap duration:** 3-7 seconds, but the dread can build over days before the sabotage moment.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪

## PATTERN 9: THE RAGE PATTERN

**The code:** Threat detected. Eliminate it. Now.

**Installation:** The child's boundaries were violated repeatedly. Or the child witnessed explosive anger as the only way to get needs met. Or the child was powerless for so long that rage became the only tool that worked. The child learned: when threatened, explode. Volume and force are the only things that stop the pain.

**How it runs:** Someone criticizes you. Disrespects you. Controls you. Or you perceive that they did. Your body floods in under two seconds. Heat. Tension. Heart rate doubles. Tunnel vision. Your prefrontal cortex goes dark. You are operating on brainstem. You yell. Say things designed to wound. Throw things. Slam doors. The words that come out are cruel and precise—because the pattern has had years to sharpen them. Then it ends. The flood recedes. And the shame arrives.

**The circuit:**
Trigger (criticism, control, disrespect) → Body (flooding, heat, heart racing) → Thought ("They crossed a line; I will make them stop") → Behavior (explode, attack verbally/physically)

**What it costs:** Relationships destroyed by things you said that you cannot unsay. Children who flinch when you raise your voice. Partners who walk on eggshells. Jobs lost. Legal consequences. And the shame spiral after every episode—which often triggers another pattern (Apology Loop, Disappearing, or Success Sabotage).

**Gap duration:** Very short. Under 3 seconds. This pattern is fast.
**Difficulty:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚪

## PATTERNS OVERLAP

Most people run two or three patterns. They interact.

Common combinations:
- **Disappearing + Testing:** Push away, then test to see if they chase.
- **Apology Loop + Compliment Deflection:** Apologize for existing, deflect any positive attention.
- **Perfectionism + Success Sabotage:** Cannot start, and if you do start, you destroy it before it finishes.
- **Attraction to Harm + Draining Bond:** Drawn to harmful people, then cannot leave them.
- **Rage + Apology Loop:** Explode, then apologize so intensely the apology becomes its own pattern.

Do not worry about combinations yet. Start with your primary. Master the interrupt for one. The skills transfer.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Every pattern was brilliant once. It kept a child alive
in an impossible room. The problem is not that it was
written. The problem is that it never updated.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Nine patterns. All installed the same way: survival code written in childhood.
• You run at least one, probably two or three.
• One is primary—the most costly, most recent, strongest body response.
• Patterns overlap and interact. Start with primary. Skills transfer.
• Every pattern has a gap. Every gap is an interrupt opportunity.
• The pattern was smart when it was written. It just never updated.
