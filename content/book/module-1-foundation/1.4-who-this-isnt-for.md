# 1.4 WHO THIS IS NOT FOR

This system works for a specific type of person with a specific type of problem. It does not work for everyone. Here is who should not use this book as their primary resource.

---

## THIS IS NOT FOR YOU IF:

**You are in active addiction.** Patterns and addiction overlap. But active addiction requires sobriety first. The neurochemistry of addiction hijacks the interrupt mechanisms this system relies on. Get sober. Then do pattern work. The patterns will still be there. They are patient.

**You are in active psychosis or severe mental health crisis.** This system requires the ability to observe your own behavior. If reality testing is compromised, observation is not reliable. Stabilize with medical support first. Then use this.

**You are being actively abused and cannot leave safely.** Your safety comes first. Pattern work while you are in danger is not effective and may be harmful. See Section 0.4 for resources. Leave first. Then do pattern work.

**You want someone to tell you it is not your fault.** It is not your fault that the pattern installed. It is your responsibility to interrupt it. This book holds both truths simultaneously. If you are looking for only the first half, this is the wrong book.

**You want a quick fix.** There is no quick fix. There is a mechanical system that works over weeks and months, not hours and days. If you are looking for an overnight transformation, you will be disappointed and you will quit. And quitting is the only way to fail.

**You are not willing to say things out loud.** The Circuit Break scripts require vocalization. There is a neurological reason. If you will only do this in your head, the system loses significant effectiveness. You do not have to shout. A whisper counts. But silent does not.

## THIS IS FOR YOU IF:

You run a pattern you can name. You watch yourself do it. You cannot stop. You are willing to try a structured approach for seven days. You are tired of insight without action.

That is the only qualification.
