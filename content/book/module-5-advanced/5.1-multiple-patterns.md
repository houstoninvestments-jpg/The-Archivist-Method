# 5.1 WORKING WITH MULTIPLE PATTERNS

## The Reality: You Do Not Run Just One

By now you have identified your primary pattern—the one that causes the most damage, runs the most frequently, or feels the most urgent. You have spent weeks or months learning its circuit, its triggers, its body signatures. You know it.

But you have probably noticed something else: you run more than one pattern.

Most people run two to four patterns with varying degrees of intensity. One is primary. The others are secondary—they activate less frequently, cause less visible damage, or operate in specific domains (one pattern at work, another in relationships).

This is normal. You are not more broken than someone with one pattern. You have a more complex program architecture. That requires a more structured approach, not a different one.

---

## The Hierarchy Rule

**Work one pattern at a time.**

This is not negotiable. The protocol is designed for single-pattern focus. Attempting to interrupt two patterns simultaneously is like trying to learn two languages at once—technically possible, practically inefficient, and likely to produce mediocre results in both.

**How to sequence:**

1. **Start with the most damaging pattern.** Not the most frequent. The most costly. The one that, if you could change one thing, you would change first.

2. **Complete one full 90-day cycle** before introducing a second pattern.

3. **After your first 90-day cycle,** you have three options:
   - Repeat the cycle for the same pattern (recommended if success rate is below 50%)
   - Begin a second pattern while maintaining the first on autopilot
   - Shift focus entirely to the second pattern

4. **Never work on more than two patterns actively.** One in active protocol. One in maintenance. That is the maximum.

---

## The Maintenance Protocol

When you shift a pattern from active work to maintenance, the daily requirement drops:

**Active pattern:** Full 5-minute daily practice + weekly check-in
**Maintenance pattern:** Daily naming (15 seconds) + weekly score (1-10)

The maintenance protocol keeps the pattern visible without consuming the cognitive resources needed for your active pattern. If the maintenance pattern flares—activation frequency or intensity increases significantly—it becomes the active pattern again.

## Cross-Pattern Activation

Some patterns activate each other. This is called a cascade.

**Common cascades:**

- **Perfectionism → Success Sabotage:** You work yourself into exhaustion perfecting something, then blow it up because the pressure became intolerable.
- **Testing → Disappearing:** You test your partner, they fail the test, you disappear.
- **Compliment Deflection → Draining Bond:** You cannot accept praise, so you over-give to feel valuable, creating a draining bond.
- **Apology Loop → Rage:** You suppress your needs through chronic apologizing until the suppression produces an explosion.
- **Attraction to Harm → Draining Bond:** You are attracted to someone who is harmful, then stay out of pattern loyalty.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Cross-pattern cascades create the illusion of
unpredictability. The subject says: "I never
know what I am going to do." But the cascade is
predictable. It follows a specific sequence
every time. Pattern A activates → produces
conditions for Pattern B → Pattern B activates.
The cascade looks chaotic from inside. From the
Archivist's position, it is a circuit diagram
with two loops instead of one. Identifying the
cascade sequence is the first step to
interrupting it.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**To interrupt a cascade:**

1. Map the sequence. Which pattern fires first? What does it produce that triggers the second?
2. Interrupt the first pattern. The cascade cannot complete if the initiating pattern is broken.
3. If the first pattern gets through, watch for the transition point—the moment between patterns. That transition is an additional intervention opportunity.

## The Pattern Inventory

Complete this inventory to understand your full pattern architecture:

| Pattern | Active? | Frequency | Intensity | Domain | Priority |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Disappearing | Y/N | Daily/Weekly/Monthly | 1-10 | Work/Relationship/Both | 1-9 |
| Apology Loop | Y/N | | | | |
| Testing | Y/N | | | | |
| Attraction to Harm | Y/N | | | | |
| Draining Bond | Y/N | | | | |
| Compliment Deflection | Y/N | | | | |
| Perfectionism | Y/N | | | | |
| Success Sabotage | Y/N | | | | |
| Rage | Y/N | | | | |

Sort by priority. Work the top one. Maintain awareness of the rest. Revisit this inventory every 90 days.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Running multiple patterns does not mean you are
more damaged. It means you survived a more
complex environment. A child in a stable but
cold home may install one pattern. A child in a
chaotic, unpredictable home may install four.
The number of patterns reflects the complexity
of the original threat—not the severity of your
brokenness. You are not more broken. You are
more adapted. And each adaptation can be
interrupted, one at a time.
