# 7.9 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: THE OVERRIDE

## What an Override Is

An override is a pre-scripted action that replaces the pattern's default behavior. You do not need to feel ready. You do not need to feel confident. You need to do the override while feeling the discomfort. That is the mechanism. Override replaces the behavior. The feelings catch up later.

## The Graduated Override Scripts

### Level 1: The Timer Submit
**When to use:** Daily tasks, emails, routine work
**What you say:** "The timer rang. I am submitting now."
**What you do:** Submit what you have when the timer rings. Close the file. Do not reopen.
**What to expect:** Anxiety spike for 10-20 minutes. Then it fades. The work is fine.

### Level 2: The Single-Pass Rule
**When to use:** Projects, deliverables, anything with a defined output
**What you say:** "One revision pass. Then it ships."
**What you do:** Complete the work. Review it once—one pass, start to finish. Note genuine errors (typos, factual mistakes, formatting issues). Fix those. Submit. No second pass.
**What to expect:** The pattern will insist you missed something. You did not. Or if you did, it is minor enough that no one will notice or care. Submit anyway.

### Level 3: The Imperfect Share
**When to use:** Creative work, personal projects, anything the pattern has been hiding
**What you say:** "This is not perfect. I am sharing it anyway."
**What you do:** Share in-progress work with someone. The novel chapter. The business idea. The drawing. Share it explicitly as unfinished. "I want your thoughts on the direction."
**What to expect:** The most intense discomfort of all the overrides. Because you are exposing unedited work on purpose. You are doing the thing the pattern was built to prevent. Do it anyway. The response you receive will almost certainly be more positive than the pattern predicted.

### Level 4: The Public Imperfection
**When to use:** When you are ready to directly challenge the pattern's core fear
**What you say:** "I am letting people see this. Flaws and all."
**What you do:** Ship something publicly without exhaustive revision. Publish the blog post. Send the proposal. Launch the project. Submit the application. Let it be seen as it is.
**What to expect:** Fear. Real fear. The pattern will tell you this is professional suicide, social exposure, career destruction. It is none of these things. It is a person submitting their work—which is what everyone else does, every day, without this level of agony.

## Override Practice Protocol

**Week 1: Timer only.** Set timers for every task. Submit when they ring. Track your anxiety on a 1-10 scale after each submission.

**Week 2: Single-pass rule.** Apply to at least three work products. One revision pass. Then submit. Track: did anyone notice the difference? (They will not.)

**Week 3: Imperfect share.** Share one in-progress piece with someone you trust. Note their response versus what the pattern predicted.

**Week 4: Public imperfection.** Ship one thing publicly. Blog post, social media, professional submission. Let it exist as-is.

## The Anti-Revision Contract

Write this down. Sign it. Put it where you work:

"I, [name], acknowledge that my revision instinct is not quality control. It is a pattern. I commit to the following:
- I will set timers and submit when they ring
- I will allow one revision pass, not four
- I will not reopen submitted work to check for errors
- I will share imperfect work with at least one person this week
- Done is better than perfect. Shipped is better than saved."

This contract is your external commitment device. The pattern cannot override a written agreement as easily as it overrides an internal intention.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The override is not "lower your standards." The
override is "submit on time and let reality—not
the pattern—tell you whether the work is good."
Reality is a better judge than the pattern. The
pattern has never said anything was good enough.
Reality says most things are.

## Maintenance

This pattern does not disappear. It quiets. It waits. It reactivates during stress, high-stakes projects, and times of transition. When it returns:

1. Notice: "The pattern is back. I am revising past the point of usefulness."
2. Timer: Set it. Use it.
3. Submit: When the timer rings.
4. Remember: It quieted before. It will quiet again.

You are not curing perfectionism. You are building a practice of shipping despite it. The practice gets easier. The pattern gets quieter. But it stays in the archive. That is okay. You do not need it gone. You need it overridden.
