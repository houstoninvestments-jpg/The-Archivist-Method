# 7.10 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: TROUBLESHOOTING

## Common Obstacles and Solutions

---

### "But my work actually IS better after revision."

Maybe. Sometimes. The first revision pass often does improve quality. The question is: does the fourth pass improve quality? The seventh? Pull up your last project. Compare draft two to the final version. What actually changed? If the changes are marginal—a word here, a formatting choice there—the revision was the pattern, not quality control.

Test: Ask someone to compare your "good enough" draft to your "final" version. If they cannot tell the difference, the extra hours were the pattern's, not yours.

### "My field actually requires perfection."

If you are a surgeon, a bridge engineer, or an air traffic controller—yes, precision matters. But even in high-precision fields, there is a defined standard. The bridge must hold X weight. The incision must be at Y location. These are specific, measurable criteria.

Your pattern does not have specific, measurable criteria. It has a feeling. "Not right yet" is not a standard. It is the pattern talking. If you work in a precision field, use the defined professional standards as your completion criteria—not the pattern's infinite demand.

### "When I submit imperfect work, I feel physically ill."

Yes. That is the pattern losing control. The nausea, the anxiety, the sense of dread—these are your nervous system responding to perceived danger. The danger is not real. No one has ever died from a typo in a quarterly report.

The discomfort is temporary. It peaks within 15-30 minutes of submission and then declines. Track it. Time it. You will see: the discomfort has a shelf life. The pattern pretends it is permanent. It is not.

### "The timer method makes me anxious before I even start."

Good. That anxiety is information. It tells you the pattern is already active before the work begins. The pattern is not responding to imperfect work—it is responding to the possibility of imperfect work. This is pre-emptive control.

Start the timer anyway. The anxiety will peak and then settle as you focus on the work. If the anxiety is so intense you cannot start, shorten the timer. Give yourself permission for a smaller output. Five minutes of writing beats zero minutes of perfect planning.

### "I tried submitting without revision and it was actually bad."

Two possibilities:

1. It was actually bad—meaning it contained factual errors, missing sections, or genuinely incomplete content. In that case, one revision pass was warranted. The Timer Method allows one pass. Use it.

2. It was "bad" by your standard—meaning it was fine by everyone else's standard, but you could see the flaws. That is not bad work. That is the pattern telling you the work is bad because it was not revised enough.

How to tell the difference: Did someone else flag a problem? If yes, address the specific problem. If no one flagged anything, the work was fine. Your standard is not the standard.

---

### "I cannot delegate because my team's work is not good enough."

Your team's work does not need to meet your standard. It needs to meet the business standard. These are different.

If their work meets the actual requirements and serves the client or stakeholder, it is good enough. If you are revising their work to meet your standard, you are doing two jobs: yours and theirs. And you are teaching them that their best is never sufficient—which is the same lesson someone taught you.

Delegate. Provide criteria. Accept work that meets criteria. The pattern will scream. Let it.

---

### "I keep reopening submitted work to check for errors."

This is the pattern's maintenance behavior. It cannot prevent you from submitting, so it pulls you back after.

Rule: Once submitted, do not reopen for 24 hours. If after 24 hours you find a genuine error, fix it. If after 24 hours you find nothing (which is what will happen 95% of the time), the pattern's pull was empty.

Block the behavior physically if needed. Close the tab. Log out of the email. Put the phone in another room. The pattern needs access to maintain the loop. Remove access.

---

### "What if my perfectionism is actually what made me successful?"

Your success happened despite the pattern, not because of it. You succeeded because you are talented, hardworking, and capable. The pattern attached itself to that success and claimed credit.

Test: Think of someone equally successful who does not agonize over every detail. They exist. In your field, in your office, in your industry. They produce good work, submit it, and move on. They are not less successful than you. They are probably more successful—because they produce more, stress less, and have time for the relationships and rest that sustain long careers.

The pattern did not build your career. You did. The pattern just made it hurt more than it needed to.

Right now, find one thing on your to-do list
that is "almost done." A draft. An email. A
decision. Submit it. Not after one more look.
Now. The gap between "almost done" and "done"
is not quality. It is fear.
