# 7.8 THE PERFECTIONISM PATTERN: HOW TO INTERRUPT

## The Interrupt Point

The Perfectionism Pattern has a specific vulnerable moment: the transition from "working" to "revising." The work is done. You are about to go back for another pass. That moment—the moment your hand reaches for the scroll bar or your mind says "one more look"—is where the interrupt lives.

You cannot prevent the pattern from firing. You can catch it at the revision point.

## The Circuit Break

When you notice the revision impulse:

**Full version:**
"I am revising again. This is the pattern, not quality control. Done is better than perfect. I am submitting now."

**Short version:**
"Done. Submit."

Say it out loud. Not in your head. The pattern lives in your head. Your voice is external. It breaks the internal loop.

---

## The Timer Method

This is the primary interrupt tool for this pattern. It works because the pattern cannot negotiate with a timer.

**Step 1:** Before starting any task, set a timer for the amount of time the task reasonably requires. Not the amount you want. Not the amount the pattern says. The reasonable amount. If you are unsure, ask someone without this pattern how long it would take them. Use their number.

**Step 2:** Work until the timer rings.

**Step 3:** When the timer rings, stop. Submit what you have. Close the file. Send the email. Walk away.

**Step 4:** Do not reopen. Do not "just check one thing." Do not go back.

The discomfort you feel when the timer rings is not a signal that the work is not ready. It is the pattern losing control. Let it lose.

Next email you write: set a 3-minute timer. When
it rings, send. Do not reread. Do not revise.
Send. The world will not end. The email will
be fine. You will survive.

## The "Good Enough" Threshold

The pattern does not have a concept of "good enough." Install one.

Before starting any task, define completion criteria in writing:
- What does "done" look like? (Be specific.)
- What is the minimum viable quality?
- Who will see this, and what do they actually need?
- What would happen if I submitted the first solid draft?

Write these down. Refer to them when the revision impulse fires. The pattern will say "but it could be better." Your written criteria say: "It meets the standard. It is done."

The criteria are your external authority. The pattern cannot argue with what you wrote before it activated.

---

## The Exposure Protocol

The pattern fears exposure. Cure: expose on purpose, in small doses.

**Week 1:** Send one email without rereading it. One. Pick a low-stakes email. Send it. Notice the anxiety. Let it pass.

**Week 2:** Submit one piece of work with only one revision pass. Not zero—one. Then stop.

**Week 3:** Share something in-progress with someone you trust. Not finished. Not polished. In-progress. Say: "This is not done. I want your thoughts."

**Week 4:** Submit something and do not check for the response. Send the deliverable. Close your email. Do not check for two hours.

Each exposure teaches your nervous system that imperfection does not result in catastrophe. The pattern learned that imperfection is dangerous. You are teaching it otherwise. Through experience, not argument.

---

## The Delegation Interrupt

If your pattern fires hardest when others do work "below your standard":

1. Assign the task with clear criteria (not your internal standard—actual business requirements)
2. Receive the work
3. If it meets the criteria, accept it. Do not revise.
4. If it does not meet the criteria, provide specific feedback. Not a redo. Feedback.
5. Resist the urge to "just do it yourself." That is the pattern, not leadership.

Your team does not need to meet your standard. They need to meet the actual standard. Those are different things. The pattern cannot tell them apart.

## What to Expect

**First week:** Intense discomfort. The pattern will fight. It will tell you the work is suffering. It will tell you people will notice the decline in quality. It will tell you the timer method is dangerous. It is lying.

**Second week:** The discomfort remains but you notice something else: you are getting more done. You are finishing things. You have energy at the end of the day. You have time you did not have before.

**Third week:** You start to see the data. The work you submitted "imperfect" was received the same as the work you used to over-revise. No one noticed the difference. Because there was no meaningful difference.

**Fourth week:** The first moment where you submit something, move on, and do not think about it. Brief. Possibly just a few seconds. But those seconds are the pattern losing its hold.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The subject reports that "good enough" feels
like failure. Observation: "good enough" is
responsible for every building you have entered,
every car you have driven, every meal you have
eaten in a restaurant. The world runs on "good
enough." Only the pattern insists on perfect.
And the pattern has never completed anything.
