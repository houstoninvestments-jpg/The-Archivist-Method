# 8.11 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
SUCCESS SABOTAGE - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Restlessness, agitation, skin-crawling, insomnia during calm
Thoughts: "This cannot last." "I am bored." "Something is about to go wrong."
Behavior: Pick fights, quit, spend, cheat, miss deadlines, create chaos
Timing: Activates during success, not during struggle. Has a set-point threshold.

**THE GAP:** During the season of restlessness—before the impulse becomes action.

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"Things are going well and I feel the urge to blow it up. This is the pattern. I do not have to act on this feeling. I can tolerate good."

**Short version:** "Tolerate good."

**THE 48-HOUR RULE:** Do not act on any destructive impulse for 48 hours. Track intensity. Most impulses collapse within 24 hours.

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: Name and wait. "The pattern is active. I am waiting 48 hours."
Level 2: Name, wait, tell. Contact your witness before acting.
Level 3: Counter-invest. Do the opposite—deepen investment in what the pattern wants to destroy.
Level 4: Public commitment. Make the commitment visible and hard to undo.

**YOUR SET POINT:** ______ (weeks/months/dollar amount). Know your threshold. Prepare before you reach it.

**FIRST WIN:** One sabotage impulse tolerated without acting. 48 hours of discomfort that you survived.

**PRACTICE:** Name the pattern (week 1). 48-hour rule on all impulses (week 2). Tell your witness (week 3). Counter-invest (week 4).

**REMEMBER:** You are not the one who ruins things. You are a person running a program that ruins things. The program can be interrupted.
