# 8.6 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: PATTERN ARCHAEOLOGY

## Subject: Kira, 31

### Current Presentation
Account executive at a tech company. Funny, magnetic, high-performing. Has been promoted once and is under consideration for another. In a relationship for five months—her longest in years. Friends describe her as "the one who always lands on her feet." She describes herself as "the one who always jumps off the cliff."

She knows what she does. She has a name for it: "the four-month thing." Every relationship, every job, every good stretch—something detonates around month four. She does not know why four months. The archive does.

### The Excavation

**Present pattern:** Kira is five months into a relationship with someone who is kind, stable, and emotionally available. She is starting to pick fights about nothing. Last week it was the dishes. Before that, his texting frequency. Before that, the way he parked. She knows the fights are meaningless. She starts them anyway. The pressure is building.

**First appearance in adulthood (age 23):** Her first serious relationship after college. Four months in, everything was good. Then she went to a party and kissed someone else. Not because she wanted to. She describes it as "watching myself do it." The relationship ended. She was devastated. And underneath the devastation—the flicker.

**Adolescent echo (age 15):** Made the varsity soccer team after years of trying. Played well for three months. Fourth month: started skipping practice. Was benched, then cut. Her mother said: "You always do this." Her mother was right. Kira already knew.

**The Original Room (age 7):**

Kira's parents had a cycle. Weeks of warmth—family dinners, movie nights, laughter. Then the explosion. Her father would drink. Her mother would scream. Objects broke. Doors slammed. Sometimes police came. Then: silence for days. Then: warmth again. The cycle repeated every three to five months, with the predictability of seasons.

The warmth was real. The family dinners were genuine. But the warmth was also a countdown. Seven-year-old Kira learned: good times have a timer. The longer the good times last, the closer the explosion. And the explosion is always worse after a long stretch of calm.

### The Installation Moment

Kira is seven. It is a Saturday. The family has been good for weeks. Her parents took her to the park that morning. She had ice cream. Her father was sober and funny and present. Her mother was relaxed. The car ride home was quiet and warm.

That night, her father drank. The fight started at 9 PM. By 10, her mother was crying in the bathroom. By 11, Kira was under her covers with her hands over her ears, listening to doors slamming.

She thought, in the way seven-year-olds think: "I should have known. It was too good. If I had seen it coming, I could have been ready. Next time I will not let the good trick me."

The program installed: Good is the warning. Calm is the countdown. If I destroy it first, I choose the timing. Choosing the timing means I am prepared. Prepared means I survive.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Installation age: 7. The subject learned that
sustained positive experience is a reliable
predictor of imminent catastrophe. Duration of
safe period: 3-5 months (matching current
sabotage threshold of ~4 months). The subject
did not learn to fear bad things. She learned
to fear good things. Specifically, she learned
that the intensity of the good directly predicts
the severity of the bad. The better it gets,
the worse the coming explosion. The survival
strategy: cap the good. Detonate before the
natural explosion. Control the timing. Minimize
the surprise. The logic was sound at seven.
At thirty-one, it is the most destructive
program in her archive.

### The Survival Logic

At age seven, the program made sense:

- Good times always end in explosion → End them yourself to control the timing
- The longer the calm, the worse the explosion → Do not let the calm last
- Being surprised by catastrophe is worse than creating it → Create it
- If I expect the worst, I cannot be blindsided → Always expect the worst

This logic kept seven-year-old Kira safe. She was never surprised by the explosions again—because she caused them. She chose the timing. She chose the intensity. The chaos felt manageable because it was hers.

But she is thirty-one. Her father has been sober for eight years. Her current partner has never raised his voice. The explosions she is bracing for do not exist in this relationship, this career, this life. She is detonating bridges to protect herself from a war that ended a decade ago.

### The Archaeology Report

**Pattern:** Success Sabotage
**Installation age:** 7
**Installer:** Family cycle (warmth → father's drinking → explosive fights → silence → repeat)
**Original threat:** Good times were a reliable predictor of imminent catastrophe
**Survival logic:** Destroy good things before they destroy you. Control the timing of the explosion.
**Current manifestation:** Sabotages relationships at ~4 months, careers at ~12-18 months, stability at any duration exceeding her set point
**Outdated element:** Current partner, career, and life do not follow the childhood cycle. The explosions are no longer coming. The only explosions that happen are the ones Kira creates.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This exercise may surface memories of childhood experiences that carry emotional weight. The goal is understanding, not reliving. If excavation brings up material that feels overwhelming, pause. Use the Emergency Protocol (Module 0). Consider working with a therapist for deeper excavation.
