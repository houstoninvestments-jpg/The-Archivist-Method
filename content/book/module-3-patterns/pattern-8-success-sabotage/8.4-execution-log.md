# 8.4 THE SUCCESS SABOTAGE PATTERN: EXECUTION LOG

## Subject: Damon, 34

### Context
Software developer. Third job in six years. Currently at month fourteen—his longest tenure. Recently told he is on track for senior engineer. Performance reviews consistently excellent. Team likes him. Work is engaging. Everything is objectively good.

This is when the pattern activates.

### The Log

**Monday, 8:15 AM**
Damon arrives at work. Standup meeting goes well. His lead mentions the team's velocity is the highest it has been in two quarters, "largely thanks to Damon's work on the API refactor."

Body: Brief warmth. Then—within seconds—a tightening in his chest. Restlessness. He shifts in his chair. His leg starts bouncing.

Thought: "That is nice. But Q3 could be different."

He opens Slack. Then, without deciding to, opens LinkedIn in another tab. Just to look. He is not job searching. He is just... looking.

**Monday, 12:30 PM**
Lunch with a colleague who says: "You should stay. This is a good place. You are doing great here."

Thought: "Am I though?"

He has no evidence of not doing great. His reviews say great. His lead says great. His code reviews are clean. But the question generates itself, and once asked, it loops.

Body: Cannot sit through lunch. Eats half his meal. Returns to his desk early.

**Tuesday, 10:00 AM**
Assigned a high-visibility project: redesigning the authentication flow for the company's primary product. This is the kind of project that leads to promotions. He knows this. His lead said so explicitly.

Thought: "If I mess this up, everyone will see."

Then, immediately: "I should quit before the project starts. Take a new role somewhere else. Fresh start."

He does not need a fresh start. His current start is working. The pattern needs a fresh start. Because the current situation has exceeded the pattern's tolerance for stability.

**Tuesday, 6:00 PM**
At home. His apartment is clean. His finances are stable. His girlfriend is cooking dinner and laughing at something on her phone. The evening is peaceful.

Body: Full activation. Heart rate elevated. Cannot focus on the TV. Stands up and sits down three times. Opens his phone, closes it. Opens the fridge, closes it.

His girlfriend asks: "Are you okay?"

"Fine. Just restless."

He is not fine. The pattern is loading. The calm evening is the trigger.

**Wednesday, 2:00 PM**
Code review for the authentication project. His code is clean. The reviewer says so. One minor suggestion. Damon fixates on the suggestion. It is trivial—a variable naming convention. But the pattern translates it: "See? Not good enough. They are already finding problems."

He does not push back on the suggestion. He implements it. Then he rewrites a section that was not flagged, introducing a bug that was not there before.

**Wednesday, 11:00 PM**
Cannot sleep. Lying in bed. Everything is fine. Girlfriend beside him. Career advancing. Health okay. Money okay.

Thought: "Something is about to go wrong."

No evidence. No reason. The prediction is the pattern's core script: good things end. Violently. Without warning. Unless you end them first.

**Thursday, 9:30 AM**
THE GAP.

Damon opens his email. There is a draft—he does not remember starting it—to a recruiter at another company. Three sentences. Casual. "Just exploring options."

He stares at the draft. His finger hovers over send.

And then he sees it. Month fourteen. Same as job two (month sixteen). Same as job one (month eighteen). He is ahead of schedule this time—the pattern is accelerating.

He thinks: "I do not want to leave. I like it here. I like my team. I like the project."

Then: "But I feel like I need to."

Then: "I felt like I needed to last time too. And the time before."

The gap opens. For the first time, he separates the feeling from the fact. The feeling says: leave. The fact says: there is no reason to leave.

**Thursday, 9:32 AM**
Circuit break, spoken aloud at his desk (quietly): "Things are going well and I feel the urge to blow it up. This is the pattern. I do not have to act on this feeling. I can tolerate good."

He deletes the draft.

**Thursday, 9:35 AM**
The agitation does not disappear. It increases. The pattern is fighting. His leg bounces. His jaw clenches. He wants to stand up, walk out, drive somewhere—anywhere that is not this stable, successful life.

He texts his girlfriend: "Having a rough morning. Pattern stuff. Can we talk tonight?"

She responds: "Of course. Love you."

He stares at "Love you." The pattern says: "She does not know what she is signing up for."

Damon says, aloud again: "Tolerate good."

He turns to the authentication project and starts working. The agitation remains. He works through it. Not because it feels good. Because the pattern does not get to decide what he does today.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The subject caught the pattern at the draft-email
stage. In previous iterations, the draft was sent.
The interview was taken. The resignation followed.
This time, the draft was deleted. The agitation
was tolerated. The work continued. Note: nothing
external changed. The job is the same. The
project is the same. The girlfriend is the same.
What changed is that the subject identified the
impulse as pattern rather than preference. He
did not want to leave. The pattern wanted him
to leave. For the first time, he knew the
difference.
