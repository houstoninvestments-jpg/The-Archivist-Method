═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE APOLOGY LOOP - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Preemptive guilt, throat tightening, physical shrinking, stomach knot
Thoughts: "I am a burden." "I should not ask." "They will be annoyed."
Urges: Lead with "sorry," over-explain, offer exit ramp, minimize need

**THE GAP:** 3-7 seconds (your interruption window)

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"I am about to apologize for [existing/asking/needing]. I have done nothing wrong. I am replacing 'sorry' with 'thank you.'"

**Short version:** "Not sorry. Thank you."

**THE SWAP:**
"Sorry I am late" → "Thank you for waiting"
"Sorry to bother you" → "Thank you for your time"
"Sorry, can I ask..." → "I have a question"

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: Replace "sorry" with "thank you." (Remove the flinch.)
Level 2: "I need [specific thing]." (State without padding.)
Level 3: "I notice I want to apologize for this. I am stating my need directly: [need]."
Level 4: "I need [thing]. My [work/situation] supports this. Can we discuss it?"

**FIRST WIN:** One request made without apologizing. "I need tomorrow off." Period.

**PRACTICE:** Count sorrys for one week. Replace one per day in week 2. Three per day in week 3.
