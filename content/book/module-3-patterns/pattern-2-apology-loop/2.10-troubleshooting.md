# 2.10 THE APOLOGY LOOP: TROUBLESHOOTING

## WHEN INTERRUPTION IS NOT WORKING

You are still saying sorry 15 times a day. The swaps are not sticking. Here is what to expect and what to adjust.

---

### WEEK 1-2: SORRYS STILL AT 100%

**What is happening:** You are counting the sorrys. The number is high. You are catching them after they come out, not before.

**This is normal.** The pattern has been running for decades. You are in the counting phase. The count itself is the intervention—you are making the invisible visible.

**What to do:** Keep counting. Do not try to stop the sorrys. Just mark them. After-the-fact awareness is the first stage. The catching will speed up.

### WEEK 3-4: CATCHING MID-SORRY, SWAP FEELS FORCED

**What is happening:** You hear yourself start to say sorry and redirect to "thank you." It feels awkward. Sometimes you say both: "Sorry—I mean, thank you for waiting." Messy. Clunky.

**This is progress.** You are catching the pattern during execution. The redirect is happening. It does not need to be graceful. "Sorry—I mean, thank you" is still a win. The correction teaches the circuit a new route.

**What to do:** Keep going. The clumsiness fades. By week 5-6, the redirect is faster. By week 8, some sorrys do not load at all.

### WEEK 5+: THREE POSSIBLE ISSUES

**Issue 1: You are only swapping low-stakes sorrys.**

You can swap "Sorry I am late" with a barista but you cannot state a need with your partner or boss. The pattern is running at full strength on high-stakes interactions.

**Fix:** The low-stakes swaps are building the muscle. They are not wasted. But you need to schedule one high-stakes interaction per week where you practice the Override at Level 2 or 3. Ask for something. State a boundary. Make a request. One per week.

**Issue 2: You feel worse, not better.**

Removing the sorry makes the guilt louder, not quieter. You feel raw. Exposed. Wrong.

**Fix:** This is the extinction burst. The pattern is fighting back because you are disrupting it. Feeling worse is counterintuitively a sign of progress. The pattern escalates before it retreats. Continue through it. If it becomes unbearable, slow down—return to Level 1 swaps for a week—but do not stop.

**Issue 3: Other people are noticing and commenting.**

"You seem different." "Are you okay?" "You are being kind of direct today."

**Fix:** This is data. People notice because the pattern was so constant that its absence is visible. You do not need to explain. If you want to, you can say: "I am working on being more direct." Or say nothing. Their adjustment is their process.

## FAILED INTERRUPT CASE STUDY

**Subject: Rachel, 41. Running the Apology Loop for 34 years.**

Rachel's friend cancels plans at the last minute. Rachel has rearranged her schedule to make this lunch work. She is disappointed. She wants to say: "I am disappointed. I moved things around for this."

She opens the text. Types: "No worries at all! Totally understand! Sorry if I made things complicated by suggesting today."

She catches it. Sees the pattern. Deletes the text. Types the Circuit Break in her notes app: "I am about to apologize for having a reaction. I have done nothing wrong."

She types a new text: "I am disappointed—I moved some things around. Can we reschedule for this week?"

Her thumb hovers over send. Guilt. "That sounds aggressive." "She will think I am mad." "Just say it is fine."

Rachel sends it.

Her friend responds in two minutes: "Oh no, I am so sorry! I did not realize you rearranged things. How about Thursday?"

No punishment. No withdrawal. No anger. A normal human response to a normal human statement.

**What Rachel learned:** The text she almost sent (three apologies, zero needs) would have left her resentful for days. The text she sent (one honest sentence) resolved the situation in two minutes.

**Adjustment made:** Rachel now drafts texts normally, then reads them before sending. If the text contains an apology for having a feeling, she rewrites.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Weeks 1-2: counting sorrys, catching them after. Normal. Keep counting.
• Weeks 3-4: clunky redirects. "Sorry—I mean, thank you." That is progress.
• Week 5+: check for low-stakes-only swaps, extinction burst, or others noticing.
• Failed interrupts still produce data. The draft-then-review method works for texts and emails.
• Other people adjust. Their surprise at your directness is temporary.
