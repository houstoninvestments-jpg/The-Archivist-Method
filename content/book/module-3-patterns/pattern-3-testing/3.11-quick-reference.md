# 3.11 THE TESTING PATTERN: QUICK REFERENCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE TESTING PATTERN - QUICK REFERENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**PATTERN MARKERS:**
Body: Heart racing, hypervigilance, chest panic, stomach dropping, restlessness
Thoughts: "They are pulling away." "If they cared, they would know." "Something is wrong."
Urges: Check their activity, compose provocative text, go cold, pick a fight, threaten to leave

**THE GAP:** Minutes to hours (longer but anxiety ferments—intervene early)

**CIRCUIT BREAK:**
"The Testing Pattern activated. I want to test if they really care. I am not creating a test. I am asking directly instead."

**Short version:** "Not a test. Ask directly."

**OVERRIDE SCRIPTS:**
Level 1: "I am having an anxious day. Can you send me something nice?"
Level 2: "I am feeling insecure right now. It is not you. Can you tell me we are okay?"
Level 3: "I have a pattern where I test people. I am trying to ask instead. I need reassurance."
Level 4: "I am scared you are going to leave. I know that is my anxiety. I need to hear you are here."

**FIRST WIN:** One moment where you ask for reassurance instead of creating a test. One text that says what you need instead of what will provoke.

**PRACTICE:** Catch surveillance (week 1). Delay tests by 10-30 min (week 2). Replace with direct ask (week 3).

COPY TO PHONE. USE WHEN HEART STARTS RACING
AND A PROVOCATIVE TEXT IS FORMING.
