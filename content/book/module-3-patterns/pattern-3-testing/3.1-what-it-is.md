# 3.1 THE TESTING PATTERN: WHAT IT IS

Things are going well. Too well. So you break them.

Not because you want to. Because the calm is louder than the chaos. Because stability feels like the silence before an explosion. Because if they are going to leave—and they are going to leave, the pattern is certain of this—then you need to know now.

So you test.

## THE PROGRAM

The Testing Pattern is anxious attachment coded into behavior. It is a survival program that says: people will leave without warning. The only way to survive is to detect the leaving before it happens. Test them. Force the issue. Make them prove they will stay—again and again and again.

This is not neediness. This is not being "too much." This is a surveillance system running in your nervous system, scanning every interaction for evidence of imminent abandonment. It finds what it is looking for because it creates what it is looking for.

The cruelest part: the tests work. People leave. Not because you were right about them. Because the tests exhausted them. The pattern created the evidence it needed to confirm its own logic.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
You are not testing to find out if they care. You
are testing to find out when they will stop. The
test is not a question. It is a prediction. And you
keep running it until the prediction comes true.

## WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

From the outside, you are the partner who starts fights about nothing. Who needs constant reassurance. Who creates drama right when things are calm. Who pushes people away and then collapses when they go.

Partners describe you as: intense, dramatic, exhausting, unpredictable, insecure.

From the inside, it does not feel like drama. It feels like vigilance. Like the only sane response to a world where people leave without warning. You are not creating problems. You are detecting them before they arrive. You are running quality control on every relationship, every day, because the last time you trusted someone to stay, they did not.

The anxiety is constant. Not just when the trigger fires. Underneath everything, there is a hum of "are they still here? do they still care? is this the day it ends?" The test is the only thing that quiets it. Briefly.

## THE SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

The Testing Pattern is the most precisely self-fulfilling pattern in the system.

Here is the loop:

1. You fear abandonment.
2. You test to see if they will leave.
3. The test creates pressure, conflict, or exhaustion.
4. They leave—not because they wanted to, but because they could not sustain the testing.
5. Their leaving confirms: people leave. The fear was justified.
6. Next relationship: test earlier, test harder, test more.

Each cycle makes the pattern stronger. Each departure is proof. The pattern does not see that it caused the departure. It only sees that the departure happened. And it was right. Again.

## WHO RUNS THIS PATTERN

You run the Testing Pattern if:

- You pick fights when things are calm
- You need to hear "I am not going anywhere" multiple times and the relief lasts less than 48 hours
- You have pushed someone away to see if they would come back
- You have created situations specifically to test loyalty
- "If they really loved me, they would know" is a thought you have had
- You feel more anxious when things are going well than when things are going badly
- You have been told you are "too intense" or "too much"

If four or more apply, this is your pattern. The panic in your chest while reading this is your confirmation.
