# 1.7 THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN: WHAT IT COSTS

This section is not about shame. It is about math.

The pattern has a price. You have been paying it. Here is the invoice.

---

## RELATIONSHIPS

The average person who runs the Disappearing Pattern has ended 5-12 relationships that could have worked. Not relationships that were bad. Relationships that triggered the pattern because they were good. Because someone got close. Because it was becoming real.

Each exit costs:

- The relationship itself
- The trust of the person you left
- Your belief that you can sustain a connection
- 3-12 months of grief you did not need to experience
- The other person's willingness to be vulnerable with the next person

Maya has ended 7 relationships in 8 years. Three of those people she still thinks about. One of them she is fairly certain was "the one." She left him because he wanted to move in together. That was four years ago. She is still alone.

The loneliness is not a side effect. It is the pattern's primary product.

## CAREER AND MONEY

The Disappearing Pattern does not only run in romance. It runs at work. Whenever a role becomes permanent, a team becomes close, or a commitment becomes real.

James has changed jobs 7 times in 9 years. Each move cost:

- Salary negotiation leverage (new hires negotiate from scratch)
- Vesting equity (stock options require staying)
- Promotion trajectory (leadership requires tenure)
- Professional relationships (networks dissolve without maintenance)

Conservative estimate: James has lost $180,000-$250,000 in cumulative salary growth, unvested equity, and missed promotions over 9 years. Not because he was not talented. Because the pattern made him leave every time commitment deepened.

## TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES

Years. The pattern costs years.

Maya: 8 years of serial relationships. None lasting long enough to build a life together. At 31, she has restarted from zero seven times. Each restart costs 6-12 months. That is 4-7 years of relationship building—gone. Not because the relationships failed. Because the pattern exited them.

James: 9 years of career restarts. He is a senior developer at 42 who should be a VP. His talent is undeniable. His resume is a red flag. Every hiring manager sees 7 jobs in 9 years and thinks: flight risk. They are right. But not for the reason they think.

Time does not come back. Every year spent running the pattern is a year not spent building something that lasts.

## HEALTH

Chronic loneliness is a health condition. The research is clear. Loneliness carries the same mortality risk as smoking 15 cigarettes per day. It increases cortisol. It weakens immune function. It accelerates cognitive decline.

The Disappearing Pattern produces chronic loneliness as its primary output. Not occasional loneliness. The kind that sits behind your sternum like a low-grade fever. Always there. Sometimes worse. Never gone.

Physical costs include:
- Elevated cortisol from chronic stress of serial relationship cycling
- Sleep disruption during withdrawal/grief periods
- Increased alcohol or substance use to manage the ache
- Chronic tension patterns (jaw, shoulders, chest) from years of suppressed flight response

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The pattern costs you the thing it promises to
protect. It says: "Leave so you will not be hurt."
You leave. You are hurt anyway. The pattern charges
full price and delivers nothing.
