THE DISAPPEARING PATTERN - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** When closeness approaches, you pull away. You leave before you can be left.

**SHOWS UP:** Romantic relationships (primary), friendships, family reconnection, work teams that get close

**THE TRIGGER:** Intimacy signals—"I love you," future plans, commitment conversations, anyone wanting closer

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Chest tightness (7/10), claustrophobic sensation, urge to flee, skin crawling

**THE BEHAVIOR:** Ghost, cancel plans, stop responding, create arguments, end relationships preemptively

**THE COST:** Chronic loneliness. Relationships that never survive past 3-6 months. A trail of people who wanted to love you.

**THE WIN:** One time where your chest tightens and you stay in the room. You open your mouth. You say one true thing instead of disappearing.

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 7-14 days of Circuit Break practice

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚫⚪⚪ (Moderate—clear body signature, identifiable Gap, but override requires vulnerability)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
