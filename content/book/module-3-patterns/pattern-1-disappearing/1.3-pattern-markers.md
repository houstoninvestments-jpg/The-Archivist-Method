## BODY SIGNATURES

When the Disappearing Pattern activates, your body responds before your brain catches up. These are the physical markers. Not all of them will apply to you. Three or four will be your primary signatures.

1. **Chest tightness.** A band around your ribs. Constriction. Feels like you cannot take a full breath. This is the most common body signature for this pattern.

2. **Claustrophobic sensation.** The room feels smaller. The person feels too close. Even if they are across the table. The space is shrinking.

3. **Skin crawling.** A surface-level agitation. Like your skin does not want to be touched. Sensory overload that is not about the senses—it is about the proximity.

4. **Urge to move.** Feet want to walk. Legs want to stand. Hands want to reach for keys, phone, door handle. The body is preparing to leave before the mind has decided to.

5. **Jaw tension.** Clenching without realizing. Grinding. The jaw locks to prevent words from coming out—words that would mean staying.

6. **Shallow breathing.** The breath moves to the upper chest. Short inhales. No exhale. Your nervous system is in low-grade fight-or-flight.

7. **Eyes scanning for exits.** Literal. You will notice yourself looking at doors, windows, your phone. Escape routes. The body is mapping the room before the brain knows why.

8. **Stomach sinking.** Not nausea. A drop. Like an elevator. The moment someone says "I love you" or "What are we?"—the floor drops.

9. **Temperature shift.** Some people get cold. The blood moves inward. Hands go cool. This is the freeze component—the body is pulling energy away from the extremities.

10. **Facial numbness.** A subtle flatness. The face stops showing what you feel. This is the mask. It goes on automatically when the pattern activates.

## AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS

After the body signature, the thoughts fire. These are not rational conclusions. They are pre-installed scripts. They sound like your voice but they were written by the pattern.

1. "I need space."
2. "This is too much."
3. "I am not ready for this."
4. "I should not have let them get this close."
5. "If I leave now, it will hurt less than if they leave later."
6. "We are moving too fast."
7. "Something feels off." (Nothing is off. The closeness is what feels off.)

Notice: every automatic thought points toward distance. Toward exit. Toward less. The pattern does not generate thoughts about staying. It generates thoughts about leaving. That is how you know it is the pattern and not your actual assessment of the relationship.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
If every thought you have after "I love you" is about
leaving, that is not evaluation. That is evacuation.
The pattern generates exit thoughts. Every time.
If the only direction your thoughts go is away,
the pattern is talking. Not you.

## BEHAVIORAL URGES

Between the thought and the behavior, there are urges. These are the pattern's action impulses.

1. **Check phone.** Not for messages. For escape. The phone is a portal out of the present moment.

2. **Manufacture a reason to leave.** "I forgot I have to..." The excuse materializes. It sounds plausible. It is not real.

3. **Start an argument.** Not about the real issue. About something small. The dishes. A comment from last week. Anything that creates friction and justifies distance.

4. **Go silent.** Words stop. Responses shorten. "Fine." "Okay." "Whatever you want." The verbal withdrawal begins before the physical withdrawal.

5. **Future-trip.** "What if this does not work out?" "What if I am making a mistake?" The mind jumps to worst-case scenarios. All of them involve staying and being destroyed.

## PRACTICE PROTOCOL: NEXT 24 HOURS

You have your markers now. Here is what to do with them in the next 24 hours.

**Step 1:** Write your top 3 body signatures on a card or in your phone notes.

Example:
- Chest tightness
- Urge to move
- Jaw clenching

**Step 2:** Set 3 phone alarms throughout the day. Label them: "Body check."

When the alarm goes off, scan your body. Are any of your markers present? Even mildly?

If yes: notice. Name it. "Chest is tight. Pattern may be running at low level." That is all. Do not intervene yet. Observe.

If no: notice that too. "No markers. Pattern is not active right now." This gives you a baseline. You need to know what non-activation feels like to recognize activation.

**Step 3:** If the pattern activates for real in the next 24 hours—if someone gets close and your chest tightens—do one thing:

Do not leave for 10 minutes.

That is it. You do not have to communicate. You do not have to be vulnerable. You do not have to do anything except stay in the room for 10 minutes longer than the pattern wants you to.

10 minutes. That is your first practice.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Chest tightness is the most common body signature. Learn yours.
• Automatic thoughts always point toward exit. That is the pattern, not you.
• Behavioral urges include phone checking, argument manufacturing, and going silent.
• Practice: 3 body check alarms per day. Notice. Name. Do not act yet.
• If activated: stay 10 minutes longer than the pattern wants. That is Day 1.
