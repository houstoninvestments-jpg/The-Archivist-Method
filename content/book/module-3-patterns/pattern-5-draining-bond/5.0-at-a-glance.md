═══════════════════════════════════════════════
THE DRAINING BOND - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** You cannot leave. A relationship, a job, a friendship, a family dynamic that is draining you—and you stay. Not because you want to. Because the pattern will not let you go.

**SHOWS UP:** Romantic relationships, toxic jobs, one-sided friendships, family obligations, caregiving roles

**THE TRIGGER:** Thinking about leaving. Someone suggesting you deserve better. Considering your own needs.

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Crushing guilt when considering leaving, heavy obligation like weight on chest, exhaustion, feeling cemented in place

**THE BEHAVIOR:** Stay. Make excuses. Absorb more harm. Lose more time. Tell yourself "It is not that bad."

**THE COST:** Years. Sometimes decades. Your health, your other relationships, your career, your sense of self—all slowly drained.

**THE WIN:** One honest acknowledgment: "I am staying because of the pattern, not because this is right for me." One small boundary set.

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 2-4 weeks (this pattern often needs professional support)

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫ (Very hard—chronic state, not acute activation. May need professional support to leave safely.)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
