# 6.10 COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION: TROUBLESHOOTING

## WHEN THE INTERRUPT IS NOT WORKING

You said "Thank you." It felt like swallowing glass. You went back to deflecting by lunch. Here is why, and what to do.

### WEEK 1-2: "THANK YOU" FEELS LIKE A LIE

**What is happening:** You say "Thank you" and your body screams: "That is not true. You do not deserve that. You are lying by accepting it."

**This is normal.** Saying "Thank you" to a compliment you do not believe is not lying. It is acknowledging that someone said something. You are not agreeing. You are receiving. A receipt is not an endorsement.

**What to do:** Keep saying it. The feeling of lying fades as the circuit rewires. In the first week, "Thank you" feels false. By week three, it feels uncomfortable. By week six, it feels possible. The trajectory is: false → uncomfortable → possible → normal. You are in stage one. Keep going.

### WEEK 2-3: YOU DEFLECTED BEFORE YOU CAUGHT IT

**What is happening:** Someone complimented you and the deflection fired before you could interrupt. "It was nothing" was out of your mouth before your brain engaged.

**This is the speed problem.** The deflection circuit fires in under two seconds. The interrupt requires conscious thought, which takes longer. You are trying to outrun a reflex with a decision.

**What to do:** Do not try to catch the deflection in the moment. Catch it after. Five minutes later. An hour later. Go back to the person and say: "Earlier when you said [compliment], I deflected. I want to try again. Thank you. I appreciate that."

This after-the-fact correction is powerful. It rewires the circuit by completing it differently—even retroactively. The person who complimented you will likely be moved. No one has ever come back to un-deflect before.

### WEEK 3-4: THREE POSSIBLE ISSUES

**Issue 1: You can do it at work but not in relationships.**

Work compliments feel professional. Manageable. Relationship compliments feel intimate. Exposing. The pattern has a hierarchy of threat, and intimacy is at the top.

**Fix:** This is expected. Keep practicing at work. Let the skill build there. Move to relationship compliments when work compliments no longer produce the heat response. Do not force the harder context before the easier one is stable.

**Issue 2: You can receive from strangers but not from people you love.**

Strangers do not matter. Their praise has no weight. The people who matter—partner, parent, close friend—their praise carries the weight of the Original Room. Receiving from them activates the original circuit at full power.

**Fix:** Practice with the middle ground. Not strangers, not your closest people. Colleagues. Casual friends. Acquaintances whose opinions matter to you but do not carry the Original Room charge. Build the skill in the middle before taking it to the deep end.

**Issue 3: The self-compliment practice is impossible.**

You can say "Thank you" to others but you cannot say "I did well" to yourself. The internal deflection is stronger than the external one.

**Fix:** Start with facts, not evaluations. Not "I did well" but "I completed that project on time." Not "I am a good parent" but "I read to my kids tonight." State what happened. No judgment. Let the facts accumulate. The evaluation will follow when the internal record has enough evidence.

## FAILED INTERRUPT CASE STUDY

**Subject: Priya, 34. Week 2 of the protocol.**

Priya's team lead sends an email to the department: "I want to recognize Priya's exceptional work on the Q3 migration. She saved the project."

Priya reads the email and her body ignites. Heat. Squirming. The urge to reply-all: "It was a team effort!" She opens a reply. Types: "Thanks, but the whole team—"

She stops. Deletes it. Types: "Thank you, Sarah. I appreciate the recognition."

Sends it. Closes her laptop. Walks to the bathroom. Her hands are shaking. Her face is burning. She feels like she just lied to forty people. Like they are all reading her reply and thinking: "Who does she think she is?"

No one is thinking that. Three people replied to the thread congratulating her. Her manager forwarded the email to the VP. The recognition is building on itself—because she let it stand.

But Priya does not see this. She is in the bathroom, fighting the urge to send a follow-up email clarifying that it really was a team effort. The deflection is still trying to fire, ten minutes after the interrupt.

**What Priya learned:** The interrupt works but the discomfort does not end when you send the "Thank you." It lingers. The pattern sends aftershocks. The urge to go back and minimize can last minutes or hours after the initial interrupt.

**Adjustment made:** Priya created a rule: no follow-up emails for one hour after accepting praise. The one-hour buffer prevents the aftershock deflection. By the time the hour is up, the urge has faded. The praise stands. The circuit did not complete. The pattern weakens by one rep.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• "Thank you" feeling like a lie is normal in weeks 1-2. You are receiving, not agreeing. Keep saying it.
• If the deflection fires before you catch it, go back and correct it retroactively. "I want to try again. Thank you."
• The pattern has a hierarchy: strangers easiest, loved ones hardest. Work the hierarchy in order.
• Self-compliments are the hardest. Start with facts ("I finished the project") before evaluations ("I did well").
• The urge to deflect lingers after the interrupt. Create a buffer. Do not follow up for one hour.
