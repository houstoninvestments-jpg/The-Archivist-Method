# 6.8 COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION: HOW TO INTERRUPT

This is one of the simplest patterns to interrupt. The interrupt is two words: "Thank you." The difficulty is not the words. It is surviving the discomfort of saying them and stopping.

## THE CIRCUIT BREAK

When someone compliments you, say this—out loud, internally, or both:

**"Someone just complimented me. I want to deflect. I am saying only: Thank you. No deflection. No minimization."**

**Short version:** "Thank you. Full stop."

Then say "Thank you." And stop talking.

That is the entire interrupt. Two words. No follow-up. No "but." No joke. No minimization. No redirect. Thank you. Period.

## WHY THIS IS HARD

The interrupt is simple. The body response is not.

When you say "Thank you" and stop, you will feel:

- Heat (the spotlight is still on)
- Urge to keep talking (the deflection wants to complete)
- Physical discomfort (squirming, shifting)
- Wrongness (as if you just lied by accepting the praise)
- Anxiety (waiting for the punishment that followed praise in the Original Room)

All of these sensations are the pattern fighting to complete its circuit. The circuit wants to fire: compliment → deflection → relief. When you block the deflection, the circuit has no relief valve. The discomfort sits.

Let it sit. The discomfort is temporary. It peaks at about 10-15 seconds after the "Thank you." By 30 seconds, it is fading. By a minute, it is manageable. You are not in danger. You are in discomfort. They are not the same thing.

## THE THREE-WEEK PROTOCOL

**Week 1: Observation only.**

Track every compliment you receive and your response. Do not try to change anything yet. Just observe. Use the tracking format from 6.3. By the end of the week, you will see your patterns: which deflection scripts you use most, which triggers fire hardest, how fast the deflection fires.

**Week 2: One "Thank you" per day.**

Choose one compliment per day—the smallest, least threatening one—and respond with only "Thank you." Hold it. Feel the discomfort. Do not follow up. Let the silence after "Thank you" exist.

Start small. A coworker says "nice shirt." Thank you. A barista says "have a great day." Thank you. You are training the circuit on low-stakes repetitions before moving to high-stakes ones.

**Week 3: Expand.**

Move to harder compliments. Work praise. Relationship praise. The ones that make your body squirm. "Thank you." Hold it. Let the discomfort pass.

By the end of week 3, the "Thank you" should feel uncomfortable but possible. It will not feel natural yet. Natural takes months. Possible takes weeks.

## THE ADVANCED INTERRUPT

Once "Thank you" is stable, add one layer:

"Thank you. I worked hard on that."

Or: "Thank you. That means a lot to me."

Or: "Thank you. I appreciate you saying that."

These additions do something radical: they validate the compliment. They do not just receive it—they confirm it. "I worked hard on that" says: this praise is earned. "That means a lot" says: your praise matters to me.

This level is harder. The body will resist more. The voice that says "Who do you think you are?" will be louder. Say it anyway. The voice is the pattern. You are not the pattern.

Right now. Today. The next time someone says
something kind about you, respond with only:
"Thank you." Two words. Then close your mouth.
Feel the squirm. Let it pass. That is one rep.
One rep changes nothing. One rep per day for 21
days changes the circuit.
