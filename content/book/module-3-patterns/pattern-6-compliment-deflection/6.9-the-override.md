# 6.9 COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION: THE OVERRIDE

The interrupt stops the deflection. The Override replaces it. These are graduated scripts for building the capacity to be seen.

---

## GRADUATED OVERRIDE SCRIPTS

### LEVEL 1: THE RECEIVE
*For when a compliment arrives and you want to deflect.*

**Say:** "Thank you."
**Then:** Close your mouth. Do not add anything. Let the silence exist.

**What it does:** Blocks the deflection circuit. The compliment lands. You do not have to agree with it. You do not have to feel it. You just have to not reject it.

**Practice:** Every compliment for one week. No exceptions. Even if the "thank you" feels like a lie. It is not a lie. It is a receipt.

---

### LEVEL 2: THE ACKNOWLEDGE
*For when you can receive without squirming (or while squirming but holding).*

**Say:** "Thank you. I appreciate that."
**Or:** "Thank you. That is kind of you to say."

**What it does:** Adds acknowledgment. You are not just receiving—you are confirming that the person's praise was welcome. This is radical for someone who has trained everyone to stop complimenting them.

**Practice:** Choose three people you trust. For one week, add the acknowledgment to their compliments. Notice their response. Most people light up when their compliment lands. You have probably never seen this because your deflections always blocked it.

---

### LEVEL 3: THE VALIDATE
*For when you are ready to own what was praised.*

**Say:** "Thank you. I worked hard on that."
**Or:** "Thank you. I am proud of how that turned out."
**Or:** "Thank you. That project meant a lot to me."

**What it does:** Confirms the praise is earned. You are telling the other person—and yourself—that the accomplishment is real. This is not arrogance. This is accuracy. You did work hard. The project did turn out well. Saying so is not bragging. It is reporting.

**Practice:** Start with accomplishments you know are real. The project you spent months on. The skill you developed over years. Say "I worked hard on that" and feel the wrongness. The wrongness is the program. You are not the program.

---

### LEVEL 4: THE INITIATE
*For when you are ready to make yourself visible without being prompted.*

**Say (at work):** "I want to highlight something I accomplished this quarter."
**Say (in relationships):** "I did something today I am proud of. Can I tell you about it?"
**Say (to yourself):** "I did well. I know I did. I do not need anyone else to confirm it."

**What it does:** Reverses the pattern entirely. Instead of deflecting visibility, you are creating it. Instead of waiting for someone to see you and then rejecting it, you are showing yourself and letting it stand.

This level is the hardest. The Original Room voice screams: "Who do you think you are? Do not brag. Do not be visible." Say it anyway. Visibility is not danger. It was danger in the Original Room. It is not danger here.

---

## THE SELF-COMPLIMENT PRACTICE

The hardest deflection to interrupt is the one you give yourself. When you do something well and your internal voice says "It was not that good" or "Anyone could have done that"—that is the pattern running internally.

Practice: Once per day, identify one thing you did well. Say it. Out loud if possible. "I handled that conversation well." "My work on that project was strong." "I was a good parent today."

The internal deflection will fire. "No you were not." "That is arrogant." "Do not jinx it."

Let it fire. Say the true thing anyway. You are building an internal record of accomplishment to replace the one the pattern has been deleting for decades.

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The subject begins at Level 1 in week 2. By week
3, "Thank you" no longer produces the heat
response in low-stakes situations. By week 4, the
subject says "I worked hard on that" to her
manager and her voice does not shake. By week 6,
she tells her mother about the promotion
recommendation. Voluntarily. Without minimizing.
Her mother says: "That is wonderful." And Priya
says: "Thank you. It is." The subject's face is
flushed. Her hands are steady.
