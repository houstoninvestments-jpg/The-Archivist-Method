# 6.3 COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION: PATTERN MARKERS

You cannot interrupt what you do not see. This section teaches you to see the deflection in real time.

## BODY SIGNATURES

When someone compliments you, your body responds before your mind does. Learn these signals:

**Primary signals:**
- Heat in face or chest (flushing)
- Physical squirming or shifting weight
- Breaking eye contact (looking down or away)
- Nervous laughter
- Shoulders pulling inward (making yourself smaller)

**Secondary signals:**
- Urge to leave the room or change the subject
- Stomach tightening
- Jaw clenching
- Hands moving to touch face, hair, or neck (self-soothing displacement)
- Speaking faster than normal

**The invisible signal:** A feeling of wrongness. Not guilt. Not anxiety. Wrongness. As if the compliment does not fit. As if the person praising you has made an error and you need to correct it before they realize the truth.

This wrongness is the pattern's signature. It is your nervous system saying: "This is not safe. This is not true. Make it stop."

## TRIGGER MAP

The pattern activates in response to being seen positively. Specific triggers:

**Direct compliments:** "You did a great job." "You look beautiful." "You are so talented."

**Indirect praise:** Being singled out in a group. Having your work held up as an example. Someone telling a third person something good about you.

**Achievement recognition:** Awards, promotions, public acknowledgment, positive performance reviews.

**Emotional vulnerability:** Someone expressing love, admiration, or deep appreciation. "I am so grateful for you." "You changed my life."

**Physical compliments:** Comments on appearance, especially when unexpected or public.

**Competence recognition:** "You are the best person for this." "No one does it like you." "We could not have done this without you."

Note which triggers fire hardest. Most people have a hierarchy. Priya could handle "nice job" in passing but froze at public recognition. Marcus could receive casual praise but deflected emotional depth. Your triggers have a specific order. Map it.

## AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS

The pattern speaks in your voice. These are its scripts:

**Minimizing:** "It was not that big a deal." "Anyone could have done it." "It was nothing, really."

**Externalizing:** "I got lucky." "The timing was right." "The team carried me."

**Correcting:** "Well, the first part was okay but I really messed up the ending." "Thanks but I should have done it faster."

**Rejecting:** "Oh stop." "No, no, no." "You are exaggerating."

**Deflecting to humor:** "Must be a slow day if that impressed you." "I peaked—it is all downhill from here."

**Redirecting:** "You should see what Sarah did." "Your work was way better."

**Future-negating:** "Watch, I will mess up the next one." "Do not get used to it."

📜 THE ARCHIVIST OBSERVES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The subject receives a compliment and immediately
produces a counter-argument. Not a pause. Not
consideration. An instant rebuttal. As if the
compliment were an accusation requiring defense.
The speed of the deflection reveals its nature:
this is not thought. It is reflex. The body
rejects the praise before the mind can evaluate
whether it is true.

## TRACKING EXERCISE

For one week, track every compliment you receive and your response. Use this format:

| Day | Compliment received | My response | Body sensation | Deflection type |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Mon | "Great presentation" | "The slides did the work" | Face heat, looked away | Externalizing |
| Tue | "You look nice today" | Nervous laugh, "This old thing?" | Squirming, chest tight | Minimizing |

After seven days, review. You will see the pattern. The same deflection types. The same body signals. The same speed—instant, automatic, reflexive.

The tracking alone begins to change the pattern. Observation creates a gap between the compliment and the deflection. That gap is where the interrupt lives.
