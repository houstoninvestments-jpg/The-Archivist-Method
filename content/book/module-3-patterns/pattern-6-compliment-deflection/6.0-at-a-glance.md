# PATTERN 6: COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION - AT A GLANCE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
COMPLIMENT DEFLECTION - AT A GLANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

**WHAT IT IS:** You cannot accept praise. Compliments make you squirm. You deflect, minimize, joke, redirect. Visibility feels dangerous.

**SHOWS UP:** Work (passed over, underpaid), relationships (partner stops complimenting you), social situations (deflecting praise publicly)

**THE TRIGGER:** Someone says something good about you. A compliment. Recognition. Praise. Achievement acknowledged publicly.

**THE BODY SIGNATURE:** Squirming, heat in face or chest, urge to shrink, nervous laughter, desire to disappear or redirect attention.

**THE BEHAVIOR:** Deflect ("It was nothing"), minimize ("Anyone could have done it"), self-deprecate ("I just got lucky"), redirect ("The team did the real work").

**THE COST:** Career stagnation. Underpaid. Invisible. Passed over for people who are louder but less capable. Partners stop telling you what they love about you because you reject it every time.

**THE WIN:** One compliment received with only "Thank you." No deflection. No joke. No minimization.

**TIME TO FIRST WIN:** 1-2 weeks (the interrupt is simple; the discomfort is the challenge)

**DIFFICULTY:** ⚫⚫⚪⚪⚪ (Moderate—simple interrupt, but the body resistance is real)

**READ TIME:** 12-15 minutes
