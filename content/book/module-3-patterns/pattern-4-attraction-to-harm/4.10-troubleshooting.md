# 4.10 ATTRACTION TO HARM: TROUBLESHOOTING

## WHEN INTERRUPTION IS NOT WORKING

You can see the pattern. You know who is safe and who is familiar. But you are still pursuing danger and rejecting safety.

---

### WEEK 1-2: STILL PURSUING THE DANGEROUS PERSON

**What is happening:** The Circuit Break fires but the neurochemistry is stronger. You said "Familiar, not safe" and texted them anyway. You know it is the pattern and you are following it anyway.

**This is normal.** This pattern has the strongest body pull of all nine. The neurochemistry of trauma bonding is similar to substance addiction. Knowing it is bad does not override the craving. Not yet.

**What to do:** Reduce access. Delete the number. Block the social media. Unfollow. You are not strong enough to resist a craving while staring at the substance. Remove the substance from your environment. This is not weakness. This is strategy.

### WEEK 3-4: GAVE THE SAFE PERSON A CHANCE. FELT NOTHING.

**What is happening:** You went on three dates with someone safe. Felt nothing. The pattern is saying: "See? I told you. No chemistry. Boring."

**Check:** Did you feel genuinely nothing—no warmth, no enjoyment, no ease? Or did you feel the absence of electricity and interpret it as nothing?

There is a difference. Nothing is: you do not enjoy their company. Their conversation is flat. You are not interested in who they are. Absence of electricity is: the conversation was fine. They were interesting. You laughed. But no surge. No obsession.

If it is genuine nothing: this specific person is not a match. That happens. Try another safe person.

If it is absence of electricity: the pattern is making the assessment. Give it three more dates. That is six total. The warmth starts slow with safe people. You are checking for growth, not for an explosion.

### WEEK 5+: THREE POSSIBLE ISSUES

**Issue 1: You are still bonded to the last dangerous person.**

You cannot move toward safety while actively bonded to danger. If you are still in contact with, thinking about, or recovering from the last volatile relationship, your nervous system is still in that template. New safe connections cannot register while the old bond is active.

**Fix:** Clean break from the dangerous person. No contact. No social media monitoring. No "checking in." The bond dissolves in 4-8 weeks without reinforcement (contact). During those weeks, sit with the withdrawal. It will feel like grief. It is not grief—it is the dopamine cycle ending.

**Issue 2: You are selecting "safe" people who are actually avoidant.**

Some people look safe but are emotionally unavailable. Stable, yes. Kind, yes. But not present. Not connected. If you are giving "safe" people a chance and still feeling flat, check: are they safe, or are they avoidant? Available means: emotionally present, willing to connect, responsive to your bids for closeness. Not just: not dangerous.

**Fix:** Look for warmth, not just stability. Safe and warm is the target. Safe and cold is avoidant—and the flatness you feel may be accurate, not the pattern.

**Issue 3: The pattern is too deeply wired for self-help alone.**

Attraction to Harm, especially when it involves repeated trauma bonding or a history of abusive relationships, may need professional support. The neurochemistry of trauma bonding is complex. A therapist who specializes in attachment or trauma can provide tools this book cannot.

**Fix:** Find a therapist who works with attachment patterns or trauma bonding. Use this system alongside therapy. The Circuit Break and safety assessment are compatible with professional treatment and strengthen it.

## FAILED INTERRUPT CASE STUDY

**Subject: Nate, 38. Running Attraction to Harm for 20 years.**

Nate meets a woman at a conference. She is smart, direct, and slightly intimidating. He feels the electricity immediately. Circuit Break fires: "Familiar, not safe."

He runs the safety assessment in his head: Is she available? She mentioned a recent breakup. Is she consistent? He does not know yet. Red flags? The intimidation factor. The immediate intensity.

He decides: 72-hour rule. No pursuing for 3 days.

Day 2: She texts him. Something witty. His hand moves to respond. He puts the phone down. Picks it up. Puts it down. Texts his friend instead: "I met someone. Electricity. Pattern?"

Friend responds: "What does she remind you of?"

Nate types: "My dad's energy."

He does not respond to her text. The 72 hours pass. The electricity fades from 9/10 to 6/10. He runs the assessment again. Unavailable (recent breakup). Intense (immediate). Familiar (reminds him of his father's energy). Assessment: pattern.

He does not pursue.

**What Nate learned:** The 72-hour rule worked because it interrupted the neurochemical escalation. At hour zero, the chemistry was at 9/10 and felt irresistible. At hour 72, it was at 6/10 and felt manageable. Time plus no contact reduced the signal strength.

**What he also learned:** Texting his friend was the critical move. His friend's question—"What does she remind you of?"—bypassed the rationalization. The answer was instant and honest: his father's energy. That was the data that confirmed the pattern.
