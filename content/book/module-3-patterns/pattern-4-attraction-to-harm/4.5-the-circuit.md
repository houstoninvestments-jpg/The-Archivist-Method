# 4.5 ATTRACTION TO HARM: THE CIRCUIT

```
TRIGGER: Meeting someone new with familiar danger signals
(intermittent, unpredictable, intense, unavailable)
    ↓ (immediate)
BODY SIGNATURE: Excitement, "butterflies," obsessive thinking
    ↓ (hours to days)
AUTOMATIC THOUGHT: "This is chemistry. This is different.
This is the one."
    ↓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ THE GAP (days—first 1-2 weeks) ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
    ↓
BEHAVIOR: Pursue dangerous person / reject safe person
    ↓
CYCLE: Intensity → Withdrawal → Return → Deeper bond
    ↓
REINFORCEMENT: "This is what love feels like. Safe = boring.
Intense = real."
```

**SIMULTANEOUS REJECTION CIRCUIT:**

```
TRIGGER: Meeting someone safe
(consistent, available, predictable, kind)
    ↓ (immediate)
BODY SIGNATURE: Flatness, boredom, nothing
    ↓ (1-3 dates)
AUTOMATIC THOUGHT: "No spark. Too nice. Something is missing."
    ↓
BEHAVIOR: Reject / stop pursuing
    ↓
REINFORCEMENT: "Safe people are not for me. I need intensity."
```

## THE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY

```
TRIGGER: Meeting someone who creates intense "chemistry"
    ↓
BODY SIGNATURE: Excitement, obsession, electricity
    ↓
AUTOMATIC THOUGHT: "This is chemistry."
    ↓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ THE GAP ⚠️
CIRCUIT BREAK: "I feel chemistry with this person.
Let me check: are they safe or familiar? This is
pattern recognition, not love. I am choosing not
to pursue until I assess."
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
    ↓
OVERRIDE: Check for safety vs familiarity.
Are they available? Consistent? Kind? Or are they
intermittent, unpredictable, intense?
    ↓
ASSESSMENT: If the "chemistry" correlates with
danger signals → pattern. Pause. Do not pursue.
    ↓
SIMULTANEOUSLY: Give the safe person 3 more dates.
Let the nervous system learn what safety feels like.
    ↓
NEW DATA: "The intense person was familiar, not
special. The safe person was uncomfortable because
safety is unfamiliar, not wrong."
```

## WHY THIS CIRCUIT RUNS THE WAY IT DOES

The neuroscience is specific here. Your attachment system was calibrated in childhood by whoever was your primary caregiver. If that caregiver was safe and consistent, your nervous system learned: safety = love. Calm = connection.

If that caregiver was unpredictable—sometimes warm, sometimes cold, sometimes present, sometimes absent—your nervous system learned a different equation: unpredictability = love. Intensity = connection. The cortisol-dopamine cycle of an inconsistent caregiver became the template for what "love" feels like in your body.

When you meet someone safe, your nervous system checks its template. Safe. Consistent. Available. The template says: this is not love. No match. No chemistry. Move on.

When you meet someone dangerous, your nervous system checks again. Unpredictable. Intense. Hot and cold. The template says: match. This is love. Activate bonding protocol.

You are not choosing wrong. Your template is wrong. The template was set by a child who had no choice in their caregiver. The template has never been updated.

The Circuit Break is the first step in updating the template. It inserts a conscious check—safe or familiar?—into the gap between the body's assessment and your behavioral response.

## CIRCUIT SPEED

**Trigger to body:** Immediate (first interaction)
**Body to thought:** Hours to days (builds over encounters)
**Gap duration:** 1-2 weeks (before neurochemistry captures)
**Total trigger to full bonding:** 2-6 weeks

This is the slowest circuit in the system. That is both good news and bad news.

Good: the gap is wide. Days to weeks where you can intervene. You can see the red flags. Your friends can point them out. Your rational brain is still online.

Bad: the circuit uses the time to build a neurochemical case. Each interaction with the dangerous person deposits more dopamine. By week 2-3, the rational brain is no longer driving. The neurochemistry is. And neurochemistry does not respond to logic.

**Intervene in week 1.** Not week 3. By week 3, you are bonded. The Circuit Break is most effective before the bond solidifies.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• Two circuits run simultaneously: pursue danger, reject safety.
• The body's "chemistry" detector was calibrated by childhood caregivers. If they were unpredictable, unpredictability = love.
• The gap is days to weeks—wide but the neurochemistry fills it fast.
• Intervene in week 1. By week 3, bonding has occurred and interruption is much harder.
• The safe person feels boring because safety is unfamiliar, not because they are wrong.
• Updating the template requires choosing safety despite the body's objection.
