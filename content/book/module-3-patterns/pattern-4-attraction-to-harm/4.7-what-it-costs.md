# 4.7 ATTRACTION TO HARM: WHAT IT COSTS

This pattern costs you the relationships you could have had. Not the ones you did have—those were the pattern. The ones you walked past. The ones you rejected. The ones you called boring.

## RELATIONSHIPS

Zara has rejected an estimated 8-12 safe partners over 15 years of dating. Each one dismissed within 1-3 dates for "no chemistry."

She has had 5 volatile relationships averaging 10 months each. Total time in toxic dynamics: approximately 4 years. Total recovery time between them: approximately 3 years. Total time spent in or recovering from pattern relationships: 7 of her 15 dating years.

During those 7 years, safe partners existed. They showed up. They were interested. They were dismissed.

The cost is not the volatile relationships. Those are the visible wreckage. The cost is the invisible wreckage: the good relationships that never happened because the pattern selected against them.

## CAREER AND MONEY

Nate has worked at three toxic companies in six years. Each one led by a charismatic, volatile leader. Each one ended in burnout.

Cost per toxic job:
- 6-18 months of recovery (reduced earning, therapy, health costs)
- Resume instability (3 jobs in 6 years raises flags)
- Health costs (stress-related illness: $2,000-$10,000 per episode)
- Opportunity cost of stable jobs declined

Nate turned down a position at a Fortune 500 company because it felt "corporate." That position would have paid $40,000 more per year with equity. Over 6 years: $240,000+ in foregone income. Plus stability. Plus health.

## TIME AND OPPORTUNITIES

Every volatile relationship or job follows the same timeline: 2-3 months of intensity, 4-8 months of cycling, 2-6 months of aftermath. Total: 8-17 months per cycle.

If you run 5 cycles between ages 20 and 35: 40-85 months. That is 3-7 years in cycles that produce nothing except the repetition of the cycle.

Those years could have been spent building one relationship. Deepening one connection. Growing one career. Instead: start over. Start over. Start over.

## HEALTH

The intensity-withdrawal-return cycle produces chronic cortisol elevation. Your body is in fight-or-flight for weeks or months at a time. Not because of a single event but because of the ongoing unpredictability of the person you bonded with.

Physical costs:
- Weight fluctuation (cortisol affects appetite and fat storage)
- Sleep disruption (hypervigilance does not sleep)
- Immune suppression (chronic stress = more illness)
- Cardiovascular strain (sustained elevated heart rate)
- Mental health: anxiety, depression, and PTSD-like symptoms from repeated volatile relationships

The cruelest health cost: after multiple cycles, your baseline anxiety is permanently elevated. Each volatile relationship raises the floor. You become more anxious, more hypervigilant, more prone to bonding with the next dangerous person. The pattern accelerates.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The pattern did not cost you bad relationships. You
knew those were bad. The pattern cost you the good
ones you never had. The quiet, steady ones you
dismissed before they could prove what love
actually looks like.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• The visible cost: years lost in toxic relationships and jobs.
• The invisible cost: safe partners and stable opportunities rejected as "boring."
• Each cycle costs 8-17 months (intensity + cycling + aftermath).
• Health cost: chronically elevated cortisol, anxiety baseline rising over time.
• The pattern accelerates. Each cycle makes you more prone to the next one.
