# 4.8 ATTRACTION TO HARM: HOW TO INTERRUPT IT

⚡ QUICK WIN: YOUR FIRST INTERRUPT (90 seconds)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Say this out loud 5 times RIGHT NOW:

"I feel chemistry with this person. Let me check:
are they safe or familiar? This is pattern
recognition, not love. I am choosing not to pursue."

Short version: "Familiar, not safe."

Say it. 5 times. Do it before reading further.

## RECOGNIZING IT IN THE GAP

The gap for Attraction to Harm is days to weeks. It opens the first time you feel "chemistry" and begins to close as the neurochemical bond forms (usually by week 2-3).

Here is how to recognize you are in the gap:

1. **Intensity is disproportionate to time spent.** You have known this person for days or weeks. You are already obsessing. You check your phone constantly. You cannot focus on work. If the emotional intensity is at a 9/10 and you have known them for a week, the pattern is running.

2. **Red flags are visible but you are rationalizing.** You can see the inconsistency. The hot and cold. The cancelled plans. The vague answers. You know these are red flags. You are explaining them away. "They are just busy." "They have been hurt before." "Nobody is perfect." Rationalization is the pattern's cover story.

3. **Safe person comparison.** You are simultaneously dismissing someone available. The contrast between "electricity with the dangerous one" and "nothing with the safe one" feels like proof. It is the pattern presenting its case.

4. **Friends are concerned.** Your friends have seen this before. If more than one person says "this sounds like the last one," they are not wrong. They are seeing the pattern from outside, where it is obvious.

**Critical timing:** Intervene in the first week. Before the neurochemistry solidifies. After week 2-3, the bond is forming and rational assessment becomes much harder.

## THE CIRCUIT BREAK SCRIPT

### FULL VERSION

Say out loud:

**"I feel chemistry with this person. Let me check: are they safe or familiar? This is pattern recognition, not love. I am choosing not to pursue until I assess."**

### SHORT VERSION (FOR OVERWHELM)

**"Familiar, not safe."**

Three words. Said when the electricity surges. When the obsession spikes. When you reach for your phone to check if they texted.

### WHEN TO USE IT

Use the Circuit Break when:
- You feel intense "chemistry" with someone you barely know
- You are rationalizing red flags
- You are about to dismiss a safe person as "boring"
- You check their social media more than 5 times a day
- You cannot stop thinking about someone who is inconsistently available
- Your friends have expressed concern about this person
- You recognize the pattern: "This is the same person with a different name"

## THE SAFETY ASSESSMENT

The Circuit Break includes "let me check: safe or familiar?" Here is the check.

**Safe indicators:**
- Texts back within a reasonable timeframe (not immediately, not days later—within hours)
- Plans dates and keeps them
- Says what they mean
- Available and does not make you guess
- You feel calm around them (not flat—calm)
- Their behavior is consistent week to week
- No one in your life is worried about them

**Familiar-danger indicators:**
- Hot and cold (intense one day, absent the next)
- You cannot predict their behavior
- They hint at depth but withhold information
- You feel "electricity" within the first 1-2 meetings
- You are already making excuses for inconsistent behavior
- They remind you of someone (often a parent or past volatile partner)
- Your friends are concerned

The assessment is not subtle. You do not need a scoring system. Read both lists. Check the one that applies. If the "familiar-danger" list matches, the pattern is selecting.

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CHOOSE SAFETY INSTEAD

The first time you stay with a safe person instead of pursuing a dangerous one:

**Week 1:** Flat. Boring. You feel nothing. The voice says: "See? No chemistry. This is not right." The voice is the pattern.

**Week 2:** Still flat. Maybe a flicker. The safe person does something kind and you feel a small warmth. It is not electricity. It is warmth. You are not used to warmth.

**Week 3-4:** The warmth increases. Slowly. You start to notice things: they show up. They do what they said. They text back. These are not exciting events. They are reliable events. Your nervous system begins to register: this person is consistent. Consistent is not the same as boring. Consistent is safe.

**Month 2-3:** Something new. A feeling that is not electricity and not flatness. It is closer to trust. You relax around them. Not the buzzing aliveness of a dangerous person. A quieter aliveness. Like settling into a warm bath instead of jumping into cold water.

**Month 3+:** What you called "no chemistry" on date one is now a deep, steady connection. It does not cycle. It does not spike. It does not crash. It just stays. And you realize: this is what love is supposed to feel like. Not the roller coaster. The ground.

This timeline is real. It has been documented in attachment research. Anxious and avoidant attachment styles can learn to bond with secure partners. It takes 3-6 months for the nervous system to recalibrate. During that time, the safe person will feel wrong. They will feel boring. They will feel insufficient. And then, gradually, they will not.

## PRACTICE PROTOCOL

### WEEK 1: THE ASSESSMENT HABIT

Every time you feel attraction—to anyone—run the safety assessment. Is this safe or familiar? Are they available or intermittent? Am I excited or activated?

Do this as a written exercise. Not in your head. On paper or in your phone. The pattern is compelling in your thoughts. It is less compelling on paper.

### WEEK 2: THE 72-HOUR RULE

When you feel intense chemistry with someone new, do not act on it for 72 hours. No texting (beyond basic politeness). No social media deep-dives. No fantasizing about a future.

At the 72-hour mark, run the safety assessment again. The chemistry will still be there. But so will your ability to evaluate.

### WEEK 3: THE THREE-DATE MINIMUM

If you meet someone safe and feel nothing, give them three dates. Not one. Three. Your nervous system needs multiple data points to begin registering a new pattern. One date is not enough data. Three is a start.

After three dates, if you still feel nothing: okay. Move on. But give safety a real chance before dismissing it.

## COMMON INTERRUPTION OBSTACLES

**1. "But what if the chemistry is real this time?"**

It might be. Genuine chemistry exists. The test: does the chemistry come with red flags? Is the person available and consistent? If yes—real chemistry. If no—the pattern. Chemistry + availability = real. Chemistry + unavailability = familiar.

**2. "I cannot help what I am attracted to."**

You cannot help the initial body response. That is automatic. You can choose what you do with it. Feeling attraction and pursuing attraction are different decisions. The Circuit Break gives you the pause between feeling and pursuing.

**3. "Safe people are genuinely boring to me."**

They are boring to your pattern. Not to you. You are not your pattern. Give safety three dates. If on date three you feel nothing—not flat, not uncomfortable, but genuinely nothing—then this specific person may not be a match. But make sure it is you assessing, not the pattern.

**4. "I already bonded. It is too late."**

It is harder after bonding. Not impossible. The Circuit Break can still work, but you may need additional support—therapy, a friend who can be blunt, or the Draining Bond chapter (Pattern 5) if you cannot leave.

**5. "I like intensity. I do not want a boring life."**

Intensity is available in safe relationships. Safe people have passions, depth, humor, complexity. What they do not have is unpredictability and cruelty. You can have intensity without danger. The pattern has convinced you these are the same thing. They are not.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
You do not have to stop feeling the electricity. You
have to stop trusting it. The electricity is a signal.
It has been signaling the wrong thing for years. Trust
the assessment, not the feeling.
