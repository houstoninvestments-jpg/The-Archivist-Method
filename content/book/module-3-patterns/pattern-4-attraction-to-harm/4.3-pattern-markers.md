# 4.3 ATTRACTION TO HARM: PATTERN MARKERS

⚡ QUICK WIN: DO THIS NOW (2 minutes)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Think of the last person you felt intense "chemistry"
with. Feel your body as you remember them.
Now think of the last safe person you rejected.
Notice the difference in your body.
The first feeling is the pattern. The second is
what safety actually feels like before your
nervous system learns to trust it.
Write down both sensations: ________________

## BODY SIGNATURES

Attraction to Harm has two sets of markers. One for the dangerous person (feels like desire). One for the safe person (feels like nothing). Both are the pattern.

### AROUND DANGEROUS/FAMILIAR PEOPLE:

1. **Intense excitement.** Heart rate elevated. Energy spiking. Feels like being plugged into an electrical socket. This is the primary marker—and the most deceptive, because it mimics genuine attraction.

2. **"Butterflies."** Stomach fluttering. Not the gentle warmth of connection. The sharp, dropping sensation of a roller coaster. This is your fight-or-flight system activating and your brain labeling it as attraction.

3. **Obsessive thinking.** Cannot stop thinking about them. Replaying conversations. Analyzing texts. Fantasizing. This is hypervigilance relabeled as infatuation. Your brain is tracking a threat and calling it love.

4. **Cannot eat, cannot sleep.** Appetite suppressed. Sleep disrupted. These are stress responses. Cortisol and norepinephrine are elevated. Your body is in a low-grade threat state. It reads as "falling in love."

5. **Magnetic pull.** A physical feeling of being drawn toward them. Hard to stay away. This is the trauma bond forming. Your nervous system is recognizing a familiar attachment pattern and locking on.

6. **Heightened senses.** Colors brighter. Music hits harder. Everything feels more vivid. This is dopamine flooding. Same chemical. Same feeling. Different cause.

### AROUND SAFE/AVAILABLE PEOPLE:

7. **Flatness.** Nothing. No electricity. No obsession. No pull. This is not "no chemistry." This is your nervous system not detecting a threat—and interpreting the absence of threat as absence of connection.

8. **Boredom.** They are "too nice." "Too available." "Too predictable." These are not flaws. These are features of a safe person. The pattern codes safety as boring.

9. **Urge to leave.** After one or two dates. "There is no spark." The assessment is instant and feels certain. But it is the pattern making the assessment, not you.

10. **Restlessness.** Around safe people, you feel antsy. Understimulated. Like you are missing something. What you are missing is the cortisol spike. Your body is accustomed to danger. Calm registers as empty.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The "boring" person is not boring. They are safe.
Your nervous system has never learned what safe
feels like from the inside. It feels like nothing.
That nothing is actually what peace feels like
before you learn to recognize it.

## AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS

### ABOUT DANGEROUS PEOPLE:
1. "This is different. They are different."
2. "The chemistry is too strong to ignore."
3. "I have never felt this way before." (You have. Every time.)
4. "I know they have issues but I see the real them."
5. "I can handle it."

### ABOUT SAFE PEOPLE:
1. "There is no spark."
2. "They are too nice."
3. "Something is missing."
4. "I do not want to lead them on."
5. "I need passion, not comfort."

Notice: the thoughts about dangerous people romanticize. The thoughts about safe people dismiss. The pattern is curating your options. Elevating danger. Eliminating safety.

## BEHAVIORAL URGES

1. **Pursue the unavailable person.** The more unavailable, the stronger the pull. If they are hot and cold, your pursuit intensifies during the cold. This is the intermittent reinforcement schedule—the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive.

2. **Reject the available person.** Quick assessment. "Nice but no spark." Gone by date three. Sometimes date one.

3. **Ignore red flags.** You see them. You rationalize them. "Everyone has a past." "They are working on it." "Nobody is perfect." The red flags are visible. The pattern applies a filter.

4. **Research and monitor.** The obsessive thinking extends to behavior: checking their social media, driving past their place, rereading texts for hidden meaning. This is surveillance coded as romance.

5. **Return after harm.** They hurt you. You go back. The return after pain produces the strongest dopamine hit of the cycle. This is the mechanism of trauma bonding.

## PRACTICE PROTOCOL: NEXT 24 HOURS

**Step 1:** Write down the last 3 people you were intensely attracted to. For each one, write: were they safe or dangerous?

Person 1: ________________. Safe / Dangerous
Person 2: ________________. Safe / Dangerous
Person 3: ________________. Safe / Dangerous

**Step 2:** Write down the last 3 people you rejected or felt nothing for. Were they safe or dangerous?

Person 1: ________________. Safe / Dangerous
Person 2: ________________. Safe / Dangerous
Person 3: ________________. Safe / Dangerous

**Step 3:** Look at the two lists. If the pattern is running, List 1 is all dangerous and List 2 is all safe. That is the pattern selecting for you.

**Step 4:** If you are currently pursuing someone or in the early stages with someone, ask: "Is this excitement or is this recognition? Am I attracted to this person or am I recognizing a familiar threat?"

You do not have to answer today. Just ask.

🔑 KEY TAKEAWAYS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
• The pattern has two marker sets: intensity around danger, flatness around safety.
• "Chemistry" with dangerous people is threat recognition mislabeled as desire.
• "No spark" with safe people is the absence of danger mislabeled as incompatibility.
• Automatic thoughts romanticize danger and dismiss safety. The pattern curates your options.
• Practice: list your last attractions and rejections. Look at who was safe and who was dangerous.
