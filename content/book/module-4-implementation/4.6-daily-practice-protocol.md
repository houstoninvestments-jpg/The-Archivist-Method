# 4.6 DAILY PRACTICE PROTOCOL

## The Five-Minute Minimum

Every day. No exceptions. Five minutes minimum.

This is the non-negotiable core of the protocol. You can skip the advanced work. You can modify the timeline. You can adjust the override levels. But you cannot skip the daily practice. The pattern runs every day. Your awareness practice must match its schedule.

---

## The Daily Five

Complete these five steps every day. Total time: 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Check In (30 seconds)

Ask yourself: "Is the pattern active right now?"

Answer with a body scan, not an intellectual assessment. Check:
- Chest: tight or open?
- Jaw: clenched or relaxed?
- Shoulders: up or down?
- Stomach: knotted or calm?
- Overall: activated or baseline?

If the body says activated: note it. You do not need to do anything about it yet. Just register it.

### Step 2: Name (15 seconds)

Say—out loud or written—one statement:

"The [pattern name] is [active / not active] right now."

That is it. One sentence. The naming is the practice. Naming externalizes the pattern and prevents it from operating as background noise.

### Step 3: Review (2 minutes)

At the end of the day, answer three questions:

1. Did the pattern activate today? When?
2. Did I catch it in real time or after?
3. Did I use the Circuit Break? What happened?

Write the answers. A note on your phone is fine. A dedicated journal is fine. A napkin is fine. The medium does not matter. The consistency does.

### Step 4: Circuit Break Rehearsal (1 minute)

Say the Circuit Break out loud. Once. Full script.

Even on days the pattern did not activate. Especially on those days. You are building muscle memory. Athletes practice on rest days. You practice on pattern-quiet days.

### Step 5: Score (15 seconds)

Rate the day: 1-10.

1 = pattern ran unopposed all day
5 = noticed the pattern, partial interruption
10 = caught every activation, successfully interrupted

Do not aim for 10. Aim for one point higher than yesterday. Incremental improvement. That is the trajectory.

## When to Practice

The best time is the time you will actually do it. Recommendations:

**Morning practice (Steps 1, 2, 4):** Before the day's triggers activate the pattern. Takes 2 minutes.

**Evening practice (Steps 1, 2, 3, 5):** After the day's events. Review and score. Takes 3 minutes.

**If you can only do one session:** Evening. The review matters more than the rehearsal.

---

## The Streak

Track your consecutive days of practice. Not as a guilt tool—as a data tool.

Day 1. Day 2. Day 3. If you miss a day, reset to Day 1. No judgment. Just reset.

Most people break the streak around Day 5-7 (the novelty wears off), Day 14-21 (the initial awareness surge fades), and Day 45-60 (the mid-protocol slump). These are predictable dropout points. Know them in advance. Push through them.

If you reach Day 30 without breaking the streak, the practice has likely become habitual. Your brain has integrated it into the daily routine. After Day 30, the streak becomes self-reinforcing—the cost of breaking it outweighs the effort of maintaining it.

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Pair the practice with something you already do
every day. Brush teeth → Step 1-2. Coffee →
Step 4. Before bed → Step 3, 5. Pairing with
existing habits eliminates the willpower cost
of remembering.

## If You Miss a Day

You will miss a day. Probably several. Here is the protocol:

1. Do not compensate by doing double the next day. That is the Perfectionism Pattern talking.
2. Do not catastrophize. One missed day does not erase the previous days.
3. Do not analyze why you missed it. The analysis is a stalling tactic.
4. Just do today's practice. Reset the streak counter. Continue.

The pattern wants you to turn a missed day into a reason to quit. "See? You cannot even do five minutes. What is the point?" The point is that you did it for [X] days before you missed one. The point is that you are doing it now.

## Advanced Daily Practice (Optional, 15 minutes)

For those who want more structure:

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- Body scan (1 minute)
- Name the pattern's current status (15 seconds)
- Visualize today's most likely trigger (1 minute)
- Rehearse the Circuit Break for that specific scenario (2 minutes)
- Set intention: "When [trigger] happens, I will [Circuit Break + Override]" (45 seconds)

**Evening (10 minutes):**
- Review the day's activations (3 minutes)
- Log each activation using the tracking format (3 minutes)
- Score the day (30 seconds)
- Rehearse the Circuit Break (1 minute)
- Plan tomorrow's most likely trigger and response (2 minutes)
- Self-acknowledgment: name one thing you did today that the pattern would not have chosen (30 seconds)
