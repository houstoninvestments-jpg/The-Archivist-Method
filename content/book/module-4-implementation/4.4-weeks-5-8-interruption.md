# 4.4 WEEKS 5-8: INTERRUPTION PHASE

## Door Three: Breaking the Circuit

You can see the pattern. You understand where it came from. Now you learn to break it in real time.

This is the hardest phase. Recognition is observation. Excavation is understanding. Interruption is action—acting against a program that has been running your behavior for decades. Your body will resist. Your mind will produce excellent reasons to skip it. The pattern will get louder before it gets quieter.

None of this means it is not working. All of it means it is.

## Week 5: Practice Runs

Do not start with live situations. Start with practice.

**Morning practice (2 minutes):**
1. Close your eyes.
2. Recall your most recent pattern activation—the trigger, the body sensation, the impulse.
3. Say the Circuit Break out loud. Full script. Every word.
4. Open your eyes. Notice how your body responds to the words.

**Evening practice (2 minutes):**
1. Review the day. Did the pattern activate?
2. If yes: replay the moment. Now insert the Circuit Break. Say it out loud as if you were in that moment.
3. If no: say the Circuit Break anyway. Maintenance practice.

**Why out loud:** The Circuit Break is a verbal override. It works through your auditory system—hearing your own voice state a different intention interrupts the automatic program. Thinking the words is not the same. The pattern thinks too. You need a different channel. Your voice is that channel.

By the end of Week 5, the Circuit Break should feel familiar in your mouth. Not comfortable—familiar. Comfort comes later. Familiarity is the Week 5 goal.

## Week 6: Low-Stakes Interruption

Now use the Circuit Break in a real situation—but choose a small one.

**Criteria for a low-stakes activation:**
- Intensity: 3/10 or lower
- Consequence: minimal (not a relationship-defining moment, not a work crisis)
- Recovery time: if the interrupt fails, you bounce back quickly

**Examples by pattern:**
- Disappearing: A casual text you want to ignore. Say the Circuit Break. Respond instead of withdrawing.
- Apology Loop: A minor interaction where you start to apologize. Catch it. Say "thank you" instead.
- Testing: A small urge to test a friend's loyalty. Catch it. Ask directly.
- Attraction to Harm: A dating profile that triggers "chemistry." Pause. Run the safety check.
- Draining Bond: One small request you would normally absorb. Say no.
- Compliment Deflection: One compliment. Say only "thank you."
- Perfectionism: One email. Send it after one read-through.
- Success Sabotage: One good moment. Sit with the discomfort. Do not act on it.
- Rage: One minor irritation. Feel the heat. Leave the room or breathe through it.

**Log every attempt.** Success or failure. The data is the point.

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Your first live Circuit Break does not need to
be perfect. It needs to happen. Say the short
version if the full script is too much. Say one
word if that is all you can manage. Any
interruption—any pause between the trigger and
the automatic response—counts. You are not
aiming for mastery. You are aiming for proof
that the circuit can be broken at all.

## Week 7: Moderate Stakes

Increase the intensity. Target a 5-6/10 activation.

**The difference:** Moderate activations have real emotional charge. Your body will resist harder. The automatic response will feel more urgent. The pattern will say: "This is not the time for an experiment."

It is always the time. The pattern will always say it is not.

**Protocol:**
1. Notice the activation (body first, then thoughts).
2. Name it internally: "The [pattern name] just activated."
3. If possible, create a micro-pause: breathe once before responding.
4. Say the Circuit Break (out loud if you are alone, internally if you are with others).
5. Choose the interrupt behavior. Do the opposite of what the pattern demands.
6. Log it afterward—even if it did not work.

**Expected success rate in Week 7:** 30-50%. This means you will fail more than you succeed. This is normal. The pattern has decades of practice. You have weeks. The success rate improves. Do not quit because of the failure rate.

## Week 8: Consolidation

Use the Circuit Break at least three times this week at any intensity level. Mix low and moderate stakes.

**Focus on:**
- Speed of recognition (how quickly do you catch the activation?)
- Quality of the pause (how long between trigger and response?)
- Completion of the Circuit Break (full script, short version, or single word?)

**Track your metrics:**

| Date | Trigger | Intensity | Caught it? | Used Circuit Break? | Worked? |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| | | /10 | Y/N | Full/Short/No | Y/N |

Review Week 8 data. You are looking for trends, not perfection. Is recognition getting faster? Is the pause getting longer? Are you using the Circuit Break more consistently?

If the answer to any of these is yes, the interruption protocol is working. Move to Phase 4.

## What Resistance Looks Like

The pattern will resist interruption. Here is what resistance looks like so you can recognize it:

**Forgetting:** You forget to practice. You forget to log. You forget the Circuit Break words. This is not poor memory. It is the pattern protecting itself.

**Intellectualizing:** "I understand the pattern now, so I do not need the Circuit Break. I can just think my way through it." No. Understanding is not interruption. You cannot think your way out of a program that operates below thought.

**Minimizing:** "My pattern is not that bad. Other people have it worse. I do not really need this." The pattern is talking. It wants you to stop before you succeed.

**Replacing:** "Maybe I should try a different approach. Meditation. Journaling. A new book." The pattern does not care what you replace this system with—as long as you replace it before it works.

**Perfectionism about the protocol:** "I did not do it perfectly so I need to start over." The pattern is using itself to sabotage its own interruption. See it. Name it. Continue imperfectly.

💎 GOLD NUGGET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
The Circuit Break does not need to work every
time to be effective. It needs to work once. One
successful interrupt proves that the circuit is
not automatic—it only appears automatic. One
proof that you can choose differently collapses
the pattern's central lie: "You have no choice."
You do. You proved it. Now do it again.
