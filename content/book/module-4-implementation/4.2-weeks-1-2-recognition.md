# 4.2 WEEKS 1-2: RECOGNITION PHASE

## Door One: Learning to See

The pattern has operated without your awareness for years. Possibly decades. Your first job is not to change it. Your first job is to see it.

This is harder than it sounds. The pattern is invisible the same way your heartbeat is invisible—it runs constantly, below conscious awareness, and your brain has learned to filter it out. Recognition Phase is about removing that filter.

## Week 1: Retroactive Recognition

You will not catch the pattern in real time during Week 1. That is fine. Week 1 is about catching it after the fact.

**Daily Protocol (5 minutes, evening):**

1. Review your day. Ask: "Did the pattern activate today?"
2. If yes: When? What triggered it? What did your body do? What did you do?
3. Log it using your pattern's tracking format.
4. If you are not sure: describe any moment of emotional intensity, reactivity, or behavior you later regretted. Check if the pattern was present.

**What you are building:** A daily awareness habit. The content of the log matters less than the consistency of the practice. Five minutes. Every evening. For fourteen days.

**Common Week 1 experiences:**
- "I did not notice anything." (Normal for Days 1-3. Keep logging. The pattern is there.)
- "I noticed it everywhere and it is overwhelming." (Also normal. You are not getting worse. You are seeing what was always there.)
- "I caught it but could not stop it." (Perfect. Catching it IS the Week 1 goal. Stopping it comes later.)

## Week 2: Real-Time Recognition

In Week 2, the goal shifts. You are no longer looking for the pattern after the fact. You are looking for it while it is happening.

**Daily Protocol (5 minutes, evening + real-time check-ins):**

1. Continue the evening log.
2. Add three daily check-in alarms (morning, afternoon, evening).
3. At each alarm, ask: "Is the pattern active right now? Has it been active since my last check?"
4. If you catch it in real time—even once—note the time, the trigger, and the body sensation.

**The Body Shortcut:**

Your body signals faster than your thoughts. If you cannot identify the pattern by its behavior, identify it by its body signature:

- Chest tightness → check for the pattern
- Jaw clenching → check for the pattern
- Heat in face → check for the pattern
- Stomach drop → check for the pattern
- Restlessness without cause → check for the pattern

Your body knows before you do. Trust it.

⚡ QUICK WIN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Pick ONE body signal—the loudest one for your
pattern. For two weeks, every time you feel that
signal, say internally: "Is that the pattern?"
You do not need to answer the question. You do
not need to do anything about it. Just ask.
The question alone begins to separate you from
the program.

## The Recognition Log

Use this format daily:

**Date:** ___________
**Pattern activated:** Yes / No / Unsure
**Time noticed:** ___________ (during or after)
**Trigger:** ___________
**Body signal:** ___________
**What I did:** ___________
**What the pattern wanted me to do:** ___________
**Were they the same?** Yes / No

That last question is the most important one in the log. "What I did" versus "what the pattern wanted me to do." In Week 1, they will almost always be the same. By Week 2, you may start to see the gap between impulse and action. That gap—even when it is a fraction of a second—is the foundation of everything that follows.

## Troubleshooting Week 1-2

**"I cannot find the pattern."**
You are looking for something dramatic. The pattern may not be dramatic. It may be a slight withdrawal, a micro-hesitation, a small avoidance. Scale down your search. Look for the whisper, not the shout.

**"I found it but then forgot to log it."**
Set a non-negotiable logging time. Pair it with something you already do—after brushing teeth, before bed, during your commute. The pattern survives on your forgetting. Logging is the antidote.

**"I noticed it but it does not match the description exactly."**
It will not match exactly. The descriptions in this book are composites. Your pattern has your specific flavor. If it is close, it counts. If you are genuinely unsure, track it anyway. Data first, diagnosis second.

**"I am seeing the pattern in everyone around me now."**
Normal. Once recognition activates, you see patterns everywhere—in your partner, your parents, your coworkers. Stay focused on yours. Other people's patterns are not your assignment.

**"This is making me feel worse, not better."**
Recognition phase often feels worse. You are seeing damage you previously ignored. This is like turning on the lights in a room you have been walking through in the dark—you see the mess, and it is distressing. But the mess was always there. The lights did not create it. And you cannot clean what you cannot see.

## End of Phase 1 Checkpoint

After 14 days, answer these questions:

1. Can I name my primary pattern? Yes / No
2. Can I identify at least one trigger? Yes / No
3. Can I identify at least one body signal? Yes / No
4. Have I caught the pattern in real time at least once? Yes / No
5. Have I logged consistently (10+ of 14 days)? Yes / No

**If you answered yes to 3 or more:** Move to Phase 2.
**If you answered yes to fewer than 3:** Repeat Week 2. There is no penalty. There is only the protocol.
