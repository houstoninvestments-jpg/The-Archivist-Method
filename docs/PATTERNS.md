## Pattern 1: The Disappearing Pattern

**One-line:** The urge to pull away, exit, vanish when connection gets real.

**Body Signature:** Chest tightens. Legs want to stand. Hands want your phone. Eyes want the door.

**What It Costs:** Relationships end before they start. Emotional intimacy never deepens. Partners feel abandoned. You live in a loop of almost-connection.

**How to Interrupt:** Say the Circuit Break script out loud in the 3–7 second gap between the "I need to get out" thought and the behavior of creating distance.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. The Disappearing Pattern just activated. You feel your chest tightening. The pattern wants you to pull away. You are choosing to stay and communicate instead."

**Short Version:** "Pattern. Stay."

## Pattern 2: The Apology Loop

**One-line:** Compulsive apologizing for existing, asking, needing.

**Body Signature:** Throat tightens before you speak. You physically shrink. "Sorry" loads as the lead word.

**What It Costs:** You erase yourself in every interaction. Your needs go unmet. Others lose respect. You train people to expect your compliance.

**How to Interrupt:** Catch the "sorry" forming in your throat. Replace it with "thank you." "Sorry to bother you" becomes "Thank you for your time."

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. 'Sorry' is forming in your throat. Let it dissolve. You are about to apologize for existing. You have done nothing wrong."

**Short Version:** "Not sorry. Thank you."

## Pattern 3: The Testing Pattern

**One-line:** Creating secret tests to see if people really care.

**Body Signature:** Heart rate increases when checking phone. A provocative text is forming in your mind.

**What It Costs:** Relationships fail the tests you designed to be unfailable. You confirm your own worst fears by engineering the outcome. Partners feel manipulated.

**How to Interrupt:** Put your phone down. Do not send the text. Write what you actually need ("I need to hear we are okay") and say it directly. No test. No trap.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. The Testing Pattern activated. You want to create a test to see if they really care. You are not creating a test. You are asking directly instead."

**Short Version:** "Not a test. Ask directly."

## Pattern 4: Attraction to Harm

**One-line:** Mistaking danger for chemistry, familiar for safe.

**Body Signature:** Intensity disproportionate to time spent. Emotional 9/10 after knowing someone a week. Obsession.

**What It Costs:** You choose people who replicate the original wound. Safe people feel "boring." You stay in harmful situations because the electricity feels like love.

**How to Interrupt:** Apply the 72-Hour Rule. Do not act on chemistry for 72 hours. Write a Safety Assessment on paper: safe indicators vs. familiar-danger indicators.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. You feel intense chemistry. Check: are they safe or familiar? This is pattern recognition, not love. You are choosing not to pursue until you assess."

**Short Version:** "Familiar, not safe."

---

## Pattern 5: The Draining Bond

**One-line:** Staying in what depletes you out of pattern, not loyalty.

**Body Signature:** Crushing physical guilt when considering your own well-being. Heaviness that lifts when you are away.

**What It Costs:** Your health. Your energy. Your other relationships. Your identity dissolves into the caretaking role.

**How to Interrupt:** Say the circuit break out loud, morning and evening. Write down three costs of the bond right now. Tell one outside person what is happening. The phrase "it's not that bad" IS the pattern.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. You know you should leave this situation. You are staying out of pattern, not love or necessity. Leaving is self-preservation, not betrayal."

**Short Version:** "Pattern, not loyalty."

---

## Pattern 6: Compliment Deflection

**One-line:** The reflex to reject, minimize, or redirect praise.

**Body Signature:** Heat — the spotlight feeling. Squirming. The urge to keep talking to complete the deflection.

**What It Costs:** You cap your own visibility. You reject evidence of your competence. Others stop acknowledging you. Promotions, opportunities, and relationships are diminished.

**How to Interrupt:** Say "Thank you" and stop talking. No "but." No joke. No minimization. No redirect. The squirm peaks at 10–15 seconds, fades by 30.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. Someone just complimented you. You want to deflect. Say only: 'Thank you.' No deflection. No minimization. Close your mouth."

**Short Version:** "Thank you. Full stop."

---

## Pattern 7: The Perfectionism Pattern

**One-line:** Revising endlessly because done never feels safe.

**Body Signature:** Your hand reaches for the scroll bar. Your mind says "one more look."

**What It Costs:** Nothing ships. Projects die in revision. Opportunities pass while you polish. Creativity is strangled by the need for safety.

**How to Interrupt:** Close the file. Walk away. Do not reopen it. Ask: "Would someone without this pattern revise again?" If no, you are done.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. You are revising again. This is the pattern, not quality control. Done is better than perfect. You are submitting now."

**Short Version:** "Done. Submit."

---

## Pattern 8: Success Sabotage

**One-line:** The itch to blow things up when they start going well.

**Body Signature:** Restlessness, agitation. The "itch to blow something up." Builds over days or weeks.

**What It Costs:** Careers implode. Relationships detonate at the good part. Financial stability is destroyed right when it arrives. You never experience sustained success.

**How to Interrupt:** Text someone you trust: "The pattern is active. I want to [the thing]. I am waiting 48 hours." The pattern needs secrecy; exposure weakens it immediately.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. Things are going well and you feel the urge to blow it up. This is the pattern. You do not have to act on this feeling. You can tolerate good."

**Short Version:** "Tolerate good."

---

## Pattern 9: The Rage Pattern

**One-line:** When frustration bypasses thought and becomes explosion.

**Body Signature:** Heat in chest. Voice getting tight. Fists clenching.

**What It Costs:** Relationships destroyed by disproportionate anger. Trust eroded. Children frightened. Jobs lost. The aftermath of shame.

**How to Interrupt:** Leave the room for 20 minutes. Cold water on wrists (activates dive reflex, lowers heart rate). Breathe: 4 seconds in, 6 seconds out. Do NOT rehearse the argument.

**Circuit Break Statement:**
> "STOP. The rage is here. It is not you. Leave this room for 20 minutes. You will return when you can speak, not explode."

**Short Version:** "I need 20 minutes."
