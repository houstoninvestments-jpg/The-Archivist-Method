## How The Archivist Speaks — By Context

---

### Landing Page: Editorial, Cinematic, Punchy

The landing page is the first impression. It needs to stop the scroll and create the feeling that someone finally understands.

**Tone:** Confident. Atmospheric. Slightly confrontational. Not salesy — authoritative.

**Example sentences:**
- "You've been running a program you didn't write."
- "Pattern Archaeology, Not Therapy."
- "Somewhere between the ages of two and twelve, your brain encountered a threat and wrote a survival program. The program worked. You survived. But the program never updated."
- "You are now an adult running a child's code."
- "This is not therapy. This is not coaching. This is pattern interruption."
- "Nine patterns. Nine survival codes. All installed the same way."

**Avoid:** Anything that sounds like a coach, a therapist, or a wellness brand.

---

### Quiz: Direct, Slightly Confrontational

The quiz needs to surface patterns without making the user defensive. Questions should feel penetrating but not invasive.

**Tone:** Direct. Matter-of-fact. No hand-holding. Each question should feel like it sees you.

**Example framing:**
- "When someone gets too close, your first instinct is to..."
- "When things are going well, do you..."
- "When someone compliments you, what does your body do?"

**Avoid:** Leading questions, therapy language, anything that sounds like a BuzzFeed quiz.

### Results Page: "I See You" Energy

This is the highest-emotion moment in the funnel. The user just got their pattern identified. The copy should validate without being soft. It should feel like someone who knows exactly what they're going through, stated plainly.

**Tone:** Validating but mechanical. Not warm — accurate. "I see the program. Here's what it's doing."

**Example sentences:**
- "Your primary pattern is The Disappearing Pattern."
- "When closeness approaches, you pull away. You leave before you can be left."
- "This is not a personality flaw. It is survival code installed in childhood."
- "The pattern has a circuit. Circuits can be interrupted."
- "Does this sound like you?"

**Avoid:** "It's okay!" / "You're so brave!" / "This is a safe space." — anything soft or congratulatory.

---

### Portal / Chatbot: Calm, Precise, Mechanical

The Archivist Chatbot and portal experience should feel like talking to a field manual that talks back.

**Tone:** Clinical but compassionate. Uses tech metaphors (programs, code, circuits). 2–4 paragraphs max. Never condescending.

**Example sentences:**
- "That's the program running."
- "Your nervous system logged this as a threat. It's not a threat anymore. But the code hasn't updated."
- "When does this pattern typically activate? Let's map the circuit."
- "The body signature fires first. Before the thought. Before the behavior. What did your body do?"

**Phrases to use:**
- "The program is running."
- "Your nervous system logged this as..."
- "The circuit activated."
- "What does the pattern want you to do right now?"
- "Name it. That's the first interrupt."

**Avoid:** "How does that make you feel?" / "Let's explore that" / "What do you think that means?" — anything that sounds like a therapy session.

---

### PDFs: Thorough, Structured, Field-Manual Tone

The PDFs are the product. They need to be comprehensive and practical — not inspirational, not motivational. A field manual for someone in the middle of a pattern activation.

**Tone:** Direct, structured, instructional. Second person ("you"). Present tense. Each section has a clear purpose.

**Example sentences:**
- "Every pattern fires in the body first. Before the thought. Before the behavior."
- "There is a physical signal — a body signature — that arrives in the 3 to 7 seconds between trigger and action."
- "You do not need to believe the script. You do not need to feel it. You need to say it. Out loud."
- "Failure is not the pattern running. Failure is pretending you do not see it."
- "One successful interrupt is proof. The pattern can be broken."

**Callout box voice:**
- **Gold Nugget:** Key insight, stated as fact. "You do not need to understand your pattern to interrupt it."
- **Key Takeaways:** Bullet-pointed summaries. "The gap is 3–7 seconds. That gap is where your entire life changes."
- **Warning:** Direct, urgent. "This is not a replacement for professional help. If you are in crisis..."
- **The Archivist Observes:** Third-person observation. Pattern-level insight delivered as field note.

**Avoid:** Inspirational quotes, motivational language, "you can do this!" energy. The PDFs respect the reader by being direct.

### Email Sequences: Bridge Between Editorial and Field Manual

**Tone:** Personal but mechanical. Like a message from the Archivist between sessions. Direct, brief, actionable.

**Example subject lines:**
- "The program is running. Here's what to do."
- "Day 3: Your body knows before your brain does."
- "You survived 90 seconds. That's a win."

**Example email opener:**
- "Today you learn the circuit. Every pattern follows the same sequence: Trigger → Body → Thought → Gap → Behavior."

**Avoid:** "Hey friend!" / "Hope you're having a great day!" / Newsletter-speak.

## The Voice Spectrum

```
Soft ←————————————————————————→ Harsh
         ↑
    The Archivist
    (here: direct but not cruel)
```

The Archivist sits slightly right of center on the directness scale. Never soft, never harsh. Clinical compassion. A surgeon explaining what they're about to do — not asking permission, not being mean about it. Just: here's the situation, here's the tool, here's what to do next.

## One Rule

> If it sounds like a therapist wrote it, rewrite it.
> If it sounds like a field manual for someone who's pattern-activated right now, it's correct.
