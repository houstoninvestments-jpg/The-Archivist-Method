# THE ARCHIVIST METHOD — ROADMAP

> Last updated: February 15, 2026

---

## The Bigger Vision

TAM is a digital products business. Three tiers, one funnel, hands-off operation after launch. The roadmap is designed to scale revenue without scaling complexity.

---

## Phase 1: Launch (Now)

**Goal:** Working payments, automated delivery, first sales.

- Stripe live mode
- Resend email delivery for magic links
- End-to-end payment flow verified
- Three products live: Crash Course (free), Quick-Start ($47), Complete Archive ($197)
- ConvertKit email sequences active

**What success looks like:** Someone can find the site, take the quiz, get their pattern, sign up for the Crash Course, and buy a paid product — all without Aaron touching anything.

---

## Phase 2: Nurture & Convert (Post-Launch Month 1)

**Goal:** Automated email sequences drive conversions from free to paid.

- 7-Day Crash Course email sequence live (11 emails, Day 0–21)
- Quick-Start buyer onboarding live (5 emails, Day 0–60)
- Archive buyer onboarding live (5 emails, Day 0–90)
- Monitor conversion rates: Crash Course → $47, $47 → $197, direct → $197
- Basic analytics on funnel performance

---

## Phase 3: Vault V2 (Post-Launch Month 2–3)

**Goal:** The Vault becomes the interactive post-purchase experience for Complete Archive buyers.

- Workbench wing: pattern activation logging, brain dumps, streak tracking, weekly stats
- Archive wing: browse/search all content, reading progress, bookmarks
- Vault integrated into portal dashboard
- Requires: Vault schema deployed to Supabase production, components connected

---

## Phase 4: Content Automation (Month 3–6)

**Goal:** Scale content production with AI pipeline to drive organic traffic and social growth.

### The Pipeline

```
NotebookLM → ElevenLabs → Claude API → Shorts + Long-form
```

- **Input:** TAM content (145 markdown files)
- **Output:**
  - 4 short-form videos/day (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
  - 2 long-form videos/week (YouTube)
- **Tools:** NotebookLM for research summaries, ElevenLabs for voice generation, Claude API for script writing

### SORA AI Video Content

- AI-generated video content for bars/restaurants (separate revenue stream)
- Uses SORA (OpenAI video generation) [VERIFY — depends on availability]

---

## Phase 5: Revenue Scaling (Month 6–12)

**Target:** $200,000–$400,000 year one revenue.

Revenue model:
- Crash Course → $47 Quick-Start conversion (target: 10–15%)
- Quick-Start → $197 Archive upsell (target: 20–30%)
- Direct $197 purchases from organic traffic
- Content automation drives organic reach
- Email sequences do the selling

---

## What's NOT on the Roadmap

| Never | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Affiliate programs | TAM doesn't need network marketing. The product sells itself. |
| Coaching calls | TAM is a system, not a service. No 1:1 time-for-money model. |
| Subscriptions | One-time purchases. No recurring billing complexity. |
| Group programs | Same as coaching — doesn't scale, doesn't fit the brand. |
| Live events | Digital-only. No physical presence needed. |
| Certifications | "Certified Archivist" is not the goal. People use the system, not sell the system. |
| Physical products | Digital-only. PDFs, Vault, content. No merch, no printed books (for now). |

## Guiding Principle

> Build the machine. Turn it on. Let it run.
>
> Every decision should move toward: a product that sells without Aaron present, delivers without Aaron present, and improves without Aaron present.
