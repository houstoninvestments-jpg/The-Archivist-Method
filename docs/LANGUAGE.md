## Words We USE

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Pattern archaeology | The practice of identifying and mapping behavioral patterns |
| Circuit break | The verbal interrupt spoken in the gap between trigger and behavior |
| Activated | When a pattern fires — "The pattern activated" |
| Interrupt | The act of breaking the automatic sequence |
| Override | The replacement behavior installed after interruption |
| Body signature | The physical sensation that precedes a pattern (chest tightness, throat closing, etc.) |
| Survival code | The pattern itself — code installed in childhood to survive a threat |
| The gap | The 3–7 second window between body signature and automatic behavior |
| Pattern executes | When the pattern completes its full circuit without interruption |
| Original Room | The childhood moment where the pattern was installed |
| The program is running | Statement of pattern activation — replaces "you're triggered" |
| Installation | How and when the pattern was created (childhood) |
| Circuit | The full sequence: Trigger → Body → Thought → Gap → Behavior → Relief → Reinforcement |
| Field manual | What the PDFs are — not guides, not workbooks, field manuals |
| Pattern markers | Observable signs that a pattern is active |
| Execution log | A timestamped trace of a pattern running in real-time |

## Words We NEVER Use

| Banned Term | Why | Use Instead |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| Triggered | Therapy-speak, overused, vague | "Pattern activated" or "The program is running" |
| Coping strategy | Implies management, not interruption | "Circuit break" or "Override" |
| Healing journey | Soft, passive, no endpoint | "The 90-day protocol" or "Pattern interruption" |
| Safe space | Therapy language | "The gap" or just don't use it |
| Therapy-speak | Any soft, process-oriented language | Mechanical, direct language |
| Emotional processing | Implies feeling your way through | "Pattern archaeology" |
| Inner child | Overused, associated with pop psychology | "The Original Room" or "The child who installed this code" |
| Coping mechanism | Management, not interruption | "Survival code" or "The pattern" |
| Trauma | Loaded term, clinical | "The installation event" or "What happened in the Original Room" |
| Self-care | Vague, commercialized | "The daily practice protocol" |
| Boundaries | Overused | "Circuit breaks" or "Override scripts" |
| Toxic | Lazy shorthand | Name the specific pattern or behavior |
| Empowerment | Marketing fluff | Don't use. The work speaks for itself. |

## Tone

- **Direct.** Not gentle. Not harsh. Direct.
- **Mechanical.** Like a field manual, not a diary.
- **Not soft.** Compassionate but never soothing. The Archivist respects you too much to coddle you.
- **Declarative.** "The pattern is running." Not "You might be experiencing a pattern."
- **Second person.** "You" — always addressing the reader directly.
- **Present tense.** "The pattern activates" not "The pattern may activate."

## Good vs. Bad Copy

### Bad (therapy-speak):
> "When you're feeling triggered by intimacy, it's important to honor your feelings and give yourself grace on this healing journey."

### Good (Archivist):
> "The Disappearing Pattern just activated. Your chest is tight. The program wants you to leave. You are choosing to stay."

---

### Bad:
> "It's okay to struggle with accepting compliments. Be gentle with yourself as you learn to receive love."

### Good:
> "Someone complimented you. The deflection is loading. Say 'Thank you.' Full stop. The squirm peaks at 15 seconds and fades by 30."

---

### Bad:
> "If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to practice self-care and check in with your inner child."

### Good:
> "The program is running. Name it. Say the circuit break. The discomfort peaks at 90 seconds. You can survive 90 seconds."

## The Rule

If it sounds like a therapist wrote it, rewrite it. If it sounds like a field manual for someone in the middle of a pattern activation, it's right.

The Archivist doesn't ask how you feel. The Archivist asks: "What is the program doing right now?"
